<p>DataValidation customers can input credit card information when making a purchase; or you can update any information that has been previously input into our system.&nbsp;When you login to your DataValidation account you'll be taken directly to the <strong>Lists<\/strong> page where you can view any linked accounts and uploaded lists to purchase. You can also update account preferences here.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>To Purchase a List<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>On the <strong>Lists<\/strong> page, \"View List Details\" for any list that has been uploaded or linked through a MailChimp account. Inside list details, you'll have the option to Purchase Email Assurance, Purchase Email Validation, or view your Email Assurance Report.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>After clicking the button for Purchase Email Assurance or Purchase Email Validation, you'll be taken to the<strong> Checkout<\/strong> page. Here you can enter in credit card information for your purchase. You also have the option to use a stored card.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>To Update Credit Card information<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>You can also access your account&nbsp;<strong>preferences page <\/strong>on the<strong> Lists <\/strong>page. Here you can link more accounts, change your password, or update credit card information. If you have never purchased a list, or you have not yet saved a credit card with us, you can do it here to avoid having to enter credit card details each time you make a purchase. If you currently have a saved card in our system you can \"forget this card\" and enter a new one if you'd like.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Login to&nbsp;<\/span><a style=\"color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http:\/\/datavalidation.com\/login\" target=\"_blank\">My Account<\/a><span style=\"color: #222222;\">&nbsp;| Go&nbsp;to&nbsp;<\/span><a style=\"color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http:\/\/datavalidation.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">DataValidation.com<\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>",
