<p>Once your list is complete, you have the option of downloading a 'Safe to Send' List or an 'Everything' List.&nbsp;These are all .csv versions of your validated list.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.datavalidation.com\/DV_NewCode_DownloadableLists.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"510\" height=\"163\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.datavalidation.com\/DV_NewCodes_WhatDoIDo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"455\" height=\"290\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>For Customers who Linked an Account:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>When you \"Upload Results\" back to your MailChimp account, your updated list will contain all emails with an Email Assurance Grade of A+, A, B, and D. The only results&nbsp;<em>not included&nbsp;<\/em>are those with a grade of F (emails deemed as undeliverable) - these emails will be unsubscribed from your MailChimp list, but will remain within your list.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>**PLEASE NOTE: Customers with linked accounts will need to segment email list results after validation and uploading is complete. We only recommend sending to the 'Safe to Send' category (including emails with a grade of A+ and A only). More on segmenting&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">here<\/span>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>For Customers who Uploaded a List:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>After purchasing, you can access your DataValidation account and download your lists. You will have the option of downloading a 'Safe to Send' List that contains all your original data plus the Email Assurance Grade for every email address or an&nbsp;'Everything' List that contains all your original data plus all of the appended Deliverability Codes for every email address. We advise&nbsp;<em>only sending<\/em>&nbsp;to the 'Safe to Send'&nbsp;list (this list contains only emails with a grade of A+ or A). All emails in the 'Safe to Send' list have been deemed as deliverable and those with a grade of A+ also have confirmed engagement activity.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Login to&nbsp;<\/span><a style=\"color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http:\/\/datavalidation.com\/login\" target=\"_blank\">My Account<\/a><span style=\"color: #222222;\">&nbsp;| Go&nbsp;to&nbsp;<\/span><a style=\"color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http:\/\/datavalidation.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">DataValidation.com<\/a><\/p>",
