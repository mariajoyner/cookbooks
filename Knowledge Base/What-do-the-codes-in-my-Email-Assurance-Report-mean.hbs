<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Get started with DataValidation by linking a MailChimp account or uploading an email list (via .csv or .xls). For every list (imported through MailChimp or uploaded to our system) you'll receive an Always Free Email Assurance Report.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\"><strong>Always Free Email Assurance Report<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This report will&nbsp;provide you Email Assurance Grades and show you how many of your emails fall in each category. This will help you to make an informed purchase decision - we believe it should always be free to know the status of your email list, at any time. Your Free Email Assurance Report will provide you with the following grades:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Email Assurance Grades:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>A+<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Deliverable + Engagement Activity<\/span>:&nbsp;The emails given a grade of A+ have been determined to be deliverable. They also have engagement history concerning email clicks and opens. These addresses are always safe to send to!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>A<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Deliverable<\/span>:&nbsp;The emails given a grade of A have been determined to be deliverable. These addresses are also safe to send to.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>B<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Accepts-all<\/span>:&nbsp;These emails have been deemed as \"Accepts-All\" -&nbsp;Server accepts all email means that the hostname has been set to accept any mail and the email address in question may be a spam trap.&nbsp;This is commonly seen in business email addresses and in many cases, the server will accept all mail and then bounce it back to sender, which in turn hurts the sender's IP Reputation.&nbsp;We do not recommend sending to the \"Accepts-All\" category. All emails with a grade of B should be segmented (until later confirmed valid).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>D&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Indeterminate<\/span>:&nbsp;In checking for an email, we were not able to do anything. The email address seems to have a mail server that is running and accepting connections, but we are unable to connect.&nbsp;We do not recommend sending to the \"Indeterminate\" category. All emails with a grade of D should be segmented&nbsp;off your list.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>F<\/strong><\/span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Undeliverable<\/span>:&nbsp;The emails given a grade of F have been deemed as undeliverable and are therefore, invalid. These emails are unsafe to send to! These addresses should always be unsubscribed from your email database.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">**After reviewing your Always Free Email Assurance Report you'll be able to make an informed purchase decision. Upon purchase, you will have access to your lists' Address-by-Address Analysis. This analysis contains Deliverability Codes which determine an email's Email Assurance Grade.&nbsp;Your Address-by-Address Analysis&nbsp;will provide you with the following:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-x-large\"><strong>Address-by-Address Analysis<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Your Always Free Email Assurance Report has already provided you with the number of emails that have each Email Assurance Grade. Now, with your Address-by-Address Analysis, you can dive deep into your email list to see exactly which emails have which grade, and why they were given that grade. Each address is also provided with Deliverability Codes that determine which grade they are given.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\">Deliverability Codes:<\/span>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Deliverability Codes are what make up an Email Assurance Grade, telling you which emails on your list are deliverable or not. These codes will provide information for each email based on their deliverability and email engagement status.&nbsp;<strong><em>Deliverability&nbsp;Codes<\/em><\/strong><em>&nbsp;are provided on a scale of 1-4, with 1 being least deliverable and 4 being most deliverable.&nbsp;<\/em><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Hard Bounces (H)<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Historical Hard Bounce information will be provided for each email address within your list. This information provides you insight by showing you which emails have a hard bounce history&nbsp;and how many sources we've received this information from.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A code of H1-H4 specifies an emails' historical hard bounce information:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>H4<\/strong>:&nbsp;No Historical Hard Bounce&nbsp;Info: This email has never&nbsp;hard bounced<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>H3<\/strong>: Single-sourced historical bounce: This address has bounced once; info provided from at least 1 source<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>H2<\/strong>: Double-sourced historical bounce: This address has bounced multiple times; info provided from at least 2 sources<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>H1<\/strong>:&nbsp;Multi-sourced historical bounce: This email has bounced multiple times; info provided from multiple sources<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Opt-Outs (O)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Historical Opt-Outs determine the number of people on your email list that have a history of opting-out, or unsubscribing, from email lists. A subscribers opt-out&nbsp;history is based on their overall email history.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A code of O1-O4 specifies an emails' historical opt-out information:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>O4<\/strong>: No Historical OptOut Info: This email has never unsubscribed&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>O3<\/strong>: Single Sourced Historical OptOut: This email has unsubscribed in the past; info from at least 1 source<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>O2<\/strong>: Double&nbsp;Sourced Historical OptOut: This email has unsubscribed more than once in the past; from at least 2 sources<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>O1<\/strong>:&nbsp;Multi-Sourced Historical OptOut: This email frequently unsubscribes; info from multiple sources<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Complainers (W)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Complainers are people who have a history of reporting email as spam. A historical complainer code will indicate whether a given email address on your list has a history of complaining about email or not.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A code of W1-W4 specifies an emails' historical complaint information:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>W4<\/strong>: No Historical Complainer Info: has never marked email as SPAM&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>W3<\/strong>: Single Sourced Historical Complainer: This address has marked email as SPAM; info from at least 1 source<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>W2<\/strong>: Double&nbsp;Sourced Historical Complainer: This address has marked email as SPAM more than once, info from at least 2 sources<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>W1<\/strong>:&nbsp;Multi-Sourced Historical Complainer: This email frequently marks other email as spam, info from multiple sources<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Spam-Traps (T)<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Emails on your list that were once deliverable and safe to send to also have the potential of turning into a spam trap if left inactive for long periods of time. When an email address is set up for the sole purpose of detecting and catching spammers, it's usually not connected to a \"real\" inbox and is considered a spam trap.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A code of T1 or T4 specifies an emails' spam-trap information:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>T4<\/strong>: We Have&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">No<\/span>&nbsp;Historical Trap Info - This email address has no history as being a spam trap.
