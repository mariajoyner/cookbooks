<p>Get started with DataValidation by linking a MailChimp account or uploading an email list (via .csv or .xls). For every list (imported through MailChimp or uploaded to our system) you'll receive an Always Free Email Assurance Report.</p><p><strong>Always Free Email Assurance Report</strong></p><p>This report willprovide you Email Assurance Grades and show you how many of your emails fall in each category. This will help you to make an informed purchase decision - we believe it should always be free to know the status of your email list, at any time. Your Free Email Assurance Report will provide you with the following grades:</p><p><strong>Email Assurance Grades:</strong></p><p><strong>A+</strong>Deliverable + Engagement Activity:The emails given a grade of A+ have been determined to be deliverable. They also have engagement history concerning email clicks and opens. These addresses are always safe to send to!</p><p><strong>A</strong> Deliverable:The emails given a grade of A have been determined to be deliverable. These addresses are also safe to send to.</p><p><strong>B</strong> Accepts-all:These emails have been deemed as "Accepts-All" -Server accepts all email means that the hostname has been set to accept any mail and the email address in question may be a spam trap.This is commonly seen in business email addresses and in many cases, the server will accept all mail and then bounce it back to sender, which in turn hurts the sender's IP Reputation.We do not recommend sending to the "Accepts-All" category. All emails with a grade of B should be segmented (until later confirmed valid).</p><p><strong>D</strong>Indeterminate:In checking for an email, we were not able to do anything. The email address seems to have a mail server that is running and accepting connections, but we are unable to connect.We do not recommend sending to the "Indeterminate" category. All emails with a grade of D should be segmentedoff your list.</p><p><strong>F</strong> Undeliverable:The emails given a grade of F have been deemed as undeliverable and are therefore, invalid. These emails are unsafe to send to! These addresses should always be unsubscribed from your email database.</p><p>**After reviewing your Always Free Email Assurance Report you'll be able to make an informed purchase decision. Upon purchase, you will have access to your lists' Address-by-Address Analysis. This analysis contains Deliverability Codes which determine an email's Email Assurance Grade.Your Address-by-Address Analysiswill provide you with the following:</p><p><strong>Address-by-Address Analysis</strong></p><p>Your Always Free Email Assurance Report has already provided you with the number of emails that have each Email Assurance Grade. Now, with your Address-by-Address Analysis, you can dive deep into your email list to see exactly which emails have which grade, and why they were given that grade. Each address is also provided with Deliverability Codes that determine which grade they are given.</p><p><strong>Deliverability Codes:</strong></p><p>Deliverability Codes are what make up an Email Assurance Grade, telling you which emails on your list are deliverable or not. These codes will provide information for each email based on their deliverability and email engagement status.<strong>DeliverabilityCodes</strong>are provided on a scale of 1-4, with 1 being least deliverable and 4 being most deliverable.</p><p><strong>Hard Bounces (H)</strong></p><p>Historical Hard Bounce information will be provided for each email address within your list. This information provides you insight by showing you which emails have a hard bounce historyand how many sources we've received this information from.</p><p>A code of H1-H4 specifies an emails' historical hard bounce information:</p><ul><li><strong>H4</strong>:No Historical Hard BounceInfo: This email has neverhard bounced</li><li><strong>H3</strong>: Single-sourced historical bounce: This address has bounced once; info provided from at least 1 source</li><li><strong>H2</strong>: Double-sourced historical bounce: This address has bounced multiple times; info provided from at least 2 sources</li><li><strong>H1</strong>:Multi-sourced historical bounce: This email has bounced multiple times; info provided from multiple sources</li></ul><p><strong>Opt-Outs (O)</strong></p><p>Historical Opt-Outs determine the number of people on your email list that have a history of opting-out, or unsubscribing, from email lists.

When an email address is set up for the sole purpose of detecting and catching spammers, it's usually not connected to a "real" inbox and is considered a spam trap.</p><p>A code of T1 or T4 specifies an emails' spam-trap information:</p><ul><li><strong>T4</strong>: We HaveNoHistorical Trap Info - This email address has no history as being a spam trap.

This email address may still be listed as active or could turn into a spam trap sometime in the future. This code indicates whether an email address belongs to a person who is deceased or not.</p><p>A code of D4 or D1 specifies if a person with this email has Historical Deceased Information:</p><ul><li><strong>D4</strong>:Nohistorical deceased information (the user is living)</li><li><strong>D1</strong>:Historical deceased information (the user is deceased)</li></ul><p>**Please Note:We no longer include deceased individuals' data in determining our Email Assurance Grades (A+, A, B, D, F) - this information changes frequently and we cannot guarantee every instance to be accurate.This information will still be provided for each email in your Address-by-Address Analysis and can used for segmenting your list.</p><p><strong>HistoricalOpens (R)</strong></p><p>This is a measure of the historical level of engagement based on the amount of deliverable mail sent to an address.
