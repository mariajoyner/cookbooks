      "body": "<p>DataValidation has just released the new Email Assurance app in beta! If you're one of our beta testers, this article is for you. Here's everything you need to get started in the new app:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Link an ESP account<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Email Assurance allows you to link a MailChimp or Constant Contact account right off the bat! Do this when signing up, or add it later. You can add multiple accounts, and even upload .csv files if you'd like.<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Linked and Unlinked Lists<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Once you've linked all of your ESP accounts (and uploaded all of your .csv files) you can view all lists in the Linked Lists and Unlinked Lists tabs. Linked Lists include all email lists from any linked MailChimp or Constant Contact account.<\/p>\r\n<p>Unlinked Lists include any lists from a previously linked ESP account, and all .csv files you have manually uploaded. (ie. If you unlink an ESP account, you can still find your lists in this section)<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.datavalidation.com\/EA_LinkedLists_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"583\" height=\"340\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Report Cards<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Each list is given an Overall List Grade.

A list's Report Card will tell you:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The percentage of emails that have each Email Assurance grade<\/li>\r\n<li>A description of each Email Assurance Grade<\/li>\r\n<li>Date of the list's latest validation<\/li>\r\n<li>Number of subscribers when the list was linked<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Progress Reports<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>In a list's Report Card, you can click on Progress Report to see the list's progress over time. The Progress Report also tells you the Overall List Grade, number of subscribers in the list, date the list was imported to Email Assurance, and details on the linked ESP account.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.datavalidation.com\/EA_ProgressReport_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"583\" height=\"419\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>By clicking on the first data point you can see what your list looked like at the time of import. The Progress Report also shows the percentage of emails that have each Email Assurance grade. Easily compare Weekly Checks and Daily Checks.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Email Assurance runs once daily to check for newly added data and re-analyzes existing data weekly. It's free to monitor your lists for as long as you like.<\/p>\r\n<p>Purchase Email Assurance or Email Assurance Plus to sync results back to your ESP account and get an address-by-address analysis for your lists.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Sync back to an ESP<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>If you have a linked MailChimp or Constant Contact account, you can purchase Email Assurance or Email Assurance Plus and have your results automatically synced back to your ESP account.

This includes manual uploads, new signups to your list or&nbsp;new addresses&nbsp;that have been recently pulled in by Email Assurance from your ESP account.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Emails Unsubscribed<\/strong>: This represents the total number of emails unsubscribed across lists. This takes into account the number of emails unsubscribed by DataValidation (due to an F grade) and the number of emails you have manually unsubscribed or that have unsubscribed themselves from your mailings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Linked Accounts, Profile Settings, and Billing<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>In the <strong>Linked Accounts<\/strong> tab you can view every ESP account you have linked to DataValidation. Here, you can unlink an account and refresh accounts. If you unlink an account, Email Assurance WILL NOT be able to run.&nbsp;Refreshing an account pulls in any new\/existing data from your ESP account (this can only be done once a day).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In the <strong>Profile Settings<\/strong> tab you can verify and change your primary mailing address, update personal information and change your password.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In the <strong>Billing Information<\/strong> tab you can&nbsp;save a credit card for purchases, change billing information and view any purchases you have made.

      "body": "<p class=\"p1\">Most email service providers are used to design and send emails, manage your subscribers, and track your campaign's performance. Their tools help marketers focus on maintaining subscriber information, bounce data, and unsubscribes. But, if you want to have an email list cleaned, you'll most likely have to use another&nbsp;service.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Any customer of DataValidation (regardless of what email service provider used) can have <strong>Email Assurance<\/strong>. Email Assurance allows you to import email lists and monitor them for no cost. If a list needs to cleaned up, or it looks like the data is starting to degrade, you can remediate the list immediately. You have the ability to track the status of your lists&nbsp;and determine when remediation is necessary.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">DataValidation also works very closely with ESPs. If you use MailChimp or Constant Contact, you have the ability to link an account and monitor every list within your account for free! Customers with linked accounts have the ability to purchase <strong>Email Assurance Plus<\/strong>. With Email Assurance Plus, all lists within your MailChimp or Constant Contact account are analyzed on a daily basis and updated automatically; there's no need to continuously clean lists.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;<\/p>",

You can view some common scenarios of list building to double check if your list is okay. The rule of thumb is to make sure you&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">always<\/span>&nbsp;have permission to email the subscribers on your list. Use a double opt-in to ensure your subscribers want to receive your mail!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mailchimp.com\/article\/is-my-list-okay-to-use-in-mailchimp\">Is my list okay to use in MailChimp?<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mailchimp.com\/article\/ask-before-you-blast\/\">The importance of permission<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\">If you want to be proactive, or you think you may risk getting flagged or suspended by MailChimp, you&rsquo;ll want to have your list cleaned of undeliverable emails. MailChimp doesn&rsquo;t do this for you, but luckily we&rsquo;ve got you covered. We partner with MailChimp and hope to provide you with the most information possible about this process.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mailchimp.com\/article\/why-cant-i-use-mailchimp-to-clean-my-list\">Why can&rsquo;t I use MailChimp to clean my list?<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Once you&rsquo;ve had a list cleaned, we will update your MailChimp account and append all delivery data, including Email Assurance Grades and Deliverability Codes, to your lists. We&rsquo;ll identify which emails are 'Safe to Send', 'Accepts-All', and 'Indeterminate'.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\">We recommend segmenting and deploying to the 'Safe to Send' emails only (with grades of A+ and A)&nbsp;to get the most out of your list. By having a list cleaned with DataValidation, you&rsquo;re&nbsp;sending to emails that have been verified as deliverable and do not have a history of bouncing, complaining, or being a spam-trap.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mailchimp.com\/article\/can-i-save-a-segment-of-my-list-in-the-list-area\/\">How can I save and use segments in my list?<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Overtime your email list(s) have the potential of going stale. People change emails or start using new ones, pass away, and leave inboxes unattended to. The permission you asked for previously from all of your subscribers (through opt-in or double opt-in) goes stale, and this usually happens in only 3-6 months, causing&nbsp;your list to be stale. This can happen even after having a list cleaned multiple times. This is why we offer the&nbsp;<strong>Email Assurance<\/strong>&nbsp;subscription specifically for MailChimp customers!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mailchimp.com\/article\/when-email-addresses-go-stale\/\">When email addresses go stale<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mailchimp.com\/article\/about-list-suspension\/\">About List Suspension<\/a><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\">Keep your MailChimp list(s) clean with ongoing list maintenance!

A subscribers opt-out&nbsp;history is based on their overall email history and can help in determining the likelihood of opting-out from your emails as well.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Complainers (W)<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Complainers are people who have a history of reporting email as spam.

      "body": "<p class=\"p1\">There&rsquo;s nothing worse than being blocked from sending email right before a campaign deployment. To avoid the stress of late delivery, or no delivery at all, we recommmend that you stay proactive in making sure your email is always deliverable. <strong>But how do you know if you&rsquo;re in danger of blocked?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>High bounce rates<\/strong>: Are many of your emails being returned to you after deploying them? You&rsquo;ll want to keep your bounce rate as low as possible to ensure email deliverability. This means, keeping your list clean of emails that have returned to you.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Damaged IP Reputation<\/strong>:&nbsp;<\/span>A sender&rsquo;s IP Reputation is the main factor in determining whether you can send email or not. Think of your reputation as a credit score for your email program.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>New list data<\/strong>: If you&rsquo;ve recently added new emails to your existing list, there&rsquo;s always a chance that some of them could be bad. Making sure emails are valid as soon as they enter your list will keep you compliance. &nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>New campaign deployment<\/strong>: We always recommend having a list cleaned before deploying a campaign to any new list, especially if the list is large in size. Also, if your list is older, there&rsquo;s a good chance the emails on it are old too.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Declining list quality<\/strong>: If you&rsquo;re noticing more and more bounces, or have received new emails from various sources, it&rsquo;s possible that your list quality is gradually declining.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Warming up an IP<\/strong>: Warming up an IP Address is a gradual process. If you&rsquo;re new to sending email, you&rsquo;ll want to keep the amount of email you send gradual as well. Volume is a very telling factor in email compliance; and making sure you deliver to clean addresses makes the warm up process much smoother.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>When you link an ESP account, or upload a list to DataValidation, we'll process your email list(s) and provide you with a Free EmailAssurance Report.

With Email Assurance, all of the lists within your MailChimp account are validated and then monitored on an ongoing, daily basis. Email Validation is our one-time cleaning service, providing an address-by-address analysis which determines the deliverability of emails on your list. It's recommend that you have a list cleaned&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">at least once every 3 months<\/span>&nbsp;with Email Validation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the monthly cost of Email Assurance?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The cost of Assurance for your linked MailChimp account is based on the number of emails you have in the lists within your account. Your one-time fee (for initial list validation) can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/201188896-How-do-I-know-the-cost-of-validating-my-email-list-\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>. With your first validation, you're given&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">one-month FREE of Email Assurance<\/span>&nbsp;- this is so you can send a few campaigns with your newly cleaned lists and get back in compliance with MailChimp's standards. Each month after that you'll be charged based on the number of emails in your lists when Email Assurance is billed at the end of the month. Calculate your monthly Email Assurance cost&nbsp;<a href=\"\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/201188916-What-is-the-cost-of-purchasing-Email-Assurance-\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>When will I be billed for Email Assurance?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You are charged a one-time fee initially for the initial validation of the lists within your MailChimp account (and given Assurance for one month&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">FREE<\/span>). After that, Email Assurance starts billing exactly one-month from when you signed up and you will be billed monthly with no long-term commitments. The cost is based on the number of emails within your lists.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>How often is my list validated?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Email Assurance is a monthly subscription that monitors your list(s) daily, scanning for new data and cleaning it every 12 hours, then c<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">leaning your list fully<\/span>&nbsp;on a once a week basis. Assurance currently runs twice a day, 7 days a week, from 11-1 EST.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the cancellation process?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can verify or cancel your monthly Email Assurance subscription at any time from within your DataValidation account. You can do this on the&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">preferences page<\/span>. When you cancel, you are no longer charged with the monthly subscription fee.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Does my list update automatically in MailChimp?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you purchase, your list(s) are validated, but&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">must be initially uploaded to your MailChimp account<\/span>. This is a one-time transaction. After the cleaned list(s) have been uploaded, we will access and update your MailChimp account automatically, requiring no action from you.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>How do I know my MailChimp account has been updated?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By looking at the Email Assurance Reports provided for your individual lists, you can tell exactly how many emails are in your list. After uploading to MailChimp, you can compare this report to the number of emails in your MailChimp lists(s) to see if your list has&nbsp;completely updated after V alidation or a daily Assurance run. The number of emails in your MailChimp account should be&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">equal<\/span>&nbsp;to the number of emails with Email Assurance Grades of A+, A, B, and D. All emails with a grade of F are unsubscribed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Does the price change if I add additional emails to my list?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you have an Email Assurance subscription, you are billed once monthly. The amount you are billed is based on the number of emails within the lists in your MailChimp account at the time of monthly billing. If you exceed a pricing category, you are simply moved up to the next pricing plan.&nbsp;Calculate your monthly cost&nbsp;<a href=\"\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/201188916-What-is-the-cost-of-purchasing-Email-Assurance-\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.&nbsp;We allow up to 30% growth of a list each month.&nbsp;You&nbsp;will be invoiced if you exceed the allotted subscriber growth.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>What happens if I delete a MailChimp list covered by Email Assurance?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you delete a list from your MailChimp account that was previously covered by Email Assurance, then it will be no longer covered.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What happens if I unlink my MailChimp account?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you have purchased Email Assurance for your MailChimp account, you&nbsp;<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">should not<\/span>&nbsp;unlink this account. By unlinking, your account no longer has a connection with DataValidation and Email Assurance will not be able to cover your account.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>What happens if I add a new list to my MailChimp account?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With Email Assurance, every list in your MailChimp account is covered. You can add lists and combine them and we will pull them in during the next assurance run. Email Assurance runs twice daily from 11-1am\/pm and all new lists will be added during this time.<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What happens if I add emails to an existing list in MailChimp?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can add subscribers, add groups and change segments within lists. All new data will be pulled in during the next Email Assurance run and updated as is in your MailChimp account. Email Assurance runs twice daily from 11-1am\/pm and all new or updated lists will be updated during the Assurance run. You are allowed a generous monthly list growth of 30%.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What information is updated with Email Assurance?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you upload your cleaned list back to MailChimp, DataValidation creates custom merge fields within your subscriber information. These fields will contain data on historical bounces, historical opt-outs, complainers, spam traps, historical click and open information. This information is updated daily with Email Assurance and can also be found in your list(s)&nbsp;<a href=\"\/hc\/en-us\/sections\/200317538-Email-Assurance-Report-List-Results\" target=\"_blank\">Email Assurance Report<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Right now, only customers who have a MailChimp account can link an account to DataValidation and be eligible for Email Assurance.

These addresses are also safe to send to.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>B<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"s1\">Accepts-all<\/span>:&nbsp;These emails have been deemed as \"Accepts-All\" -&nbsp;Server accepts all email means that the hostname has been set to accept any mail and the email address in question may be a spam trap.&nbsp;This is commonly seen in business email addresses and in many cases, the server will accept all mail and then bounce it back to sender, which in turn hurts the sender's IP Reputation.&nbsp;We do not recommend sending to the \"Accepts-All\" category. All emails with a grade of B should be segmented (until later confirmed valid).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>D&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\">Indeterminate<\/span>:&nbsp;In checking for an email, we were not able to do anything. The email address seems to have a mail server that is running and accepting connections, but we are unable to connect.&nbsp;We do not recommend sending to the \"Indeterminate\" category. All emails with a grade of D should be segmented&nbsp;off your list.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>F<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span class=\"s1\">Undeliverable<\/span>:&nbsp;The emails given a grade of F have been deemed as undeliverable and are therefore, invalid.

This information changes frequently and we cannot guarantee every instance to be accurate.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">This information will still be provided for each email in your Address-by-Address Analysis and can used for segmenting your list.&nbsp;A code of T1 determines which emails on your list (that were once deliverable and safe to send to) also have the potential of turning into a spam trap if left inactive for long periods of time. When an email address is set up for the sole purpose of detecting and catching spammers, it's usually not connected to a \"real\" inbox and is considered a spam trap.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">A code of T1 or T4 specifies an emails' spam-trap information<\/span>:<\/p>\r\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\r\n<li class=\"li3\"><strong>T4<\/strong>: We Have&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\">No<\/span>&nbsp;Historical Trap Info - This email address has no history as being a spam trap.

A high rate of complaints, opt-outs, or bounces will affect MailChimp&rsquo;s overall ability to get your mail in your subscribers&rsquo; inboxes. While some email service providers will let you deploy email to A+, A, B, and D results, MailChimp only allows you to send mail to A+ and A results, and requires a reconfirm campaign to protect their reputation with ISPs.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Unfortunately, you cannot use MailChimp to send the reconfirm campaign (<a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mailchimp.com\/article\/stay-compliant-with-casl\/\" target=\"_blank\">unless it is for CASL compliance<\/a>.)

If you have certain email addresses that you know are active, and you have mailed to them in the past 2 weeks, you can create a manual segment with these emails and slowly trickle those emails into your campaigns. You can also sign up for <a href=\"http:\/\/reconfirm.io\" target=\"_blank\">Reconfirm.io<\/a> (currently in private beta) to send your reconfirm campaign.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>What&rsquo;s the difference between a reconfirm campaign and reengagement campaign?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Before deploying a reconfirm campaign, the subscribers are removed from your Master mailing list. These subscribers are only added back on your list if they re-optin. A reconfirm campaign is a basic opt-in form and is designed to renew permissions from subscribers that have not been deployed email in 6+ months, as well as B and D Email Assurance grades.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">A reengagement campaign is designed for inactive subscribers on an active, clean email list. Subscribers that have not opened or clicked in the past 3-5 months are segmented and emailed. While there are many approaches to reengagement campaigns, the goal is to get the subscriber to engage with the email. This is a best practice used by email marketers to give subscribers options to re-engage prior to pruning them from a list. If a subscriber doesn&rsquo;t engage with a reengagement campaign, they should not be regularly mailed as it negatively affects your sender reputation.<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">For more on reengagement campaigns:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\r\n<li><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.datavalidation.com\/blog\/if-you-love-your-subscribers-let-them-go-1.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If You Love Your Subscribers, Let Them Go [Part 1]<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.datavalidation.com\/blog\/if-you-love-your-subscribers-let-them-go-2.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">If You Love Your Subscribers, Let Them Go [Part 2]<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">For more on reconfirm campaigns:<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\">\r\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mailchimp.com\/article\/reconfirm-your-list\" target=\"_blank\">How to Reconfirm My List<\/a><\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/kb.mailchimp.com\/article\/when-email-addresses-go-stale\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">When Email Addresses Go Stale<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/reconfirm.io\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Reconfirm.io<\/span><\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #555555; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-family: Arial, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Login to&nbsp;<\/span><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http:\/\/datavalidation.com\/login\" target=\"_blank\">My Account<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">&nbsp;| Go&nbsp;to&nbsp;<\/span><a style=\"color: #158ec2; font-size: 14px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http:\/\/datavalidation.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">DataValidation.com<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p>",

      "body": "<p class=\"p1\">Email is considered one of the most important forms of communication in business and marketing; for eCommerce companies, nonprofits, and large or small businesses. Sending content to your customers is vital, regardless the size of your email list. If you have invalid emails or spam traps in these lists, your sender reputation will be negatively impacted over time, and your messages may never reach those customers. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">It&rsquo;s important to keep your lists clean so that you can continuously send content and reach the inboxes of your valued customers. Having your emails validated will get you back to sending and is the first step in ongoing list maintenance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">To uphold a good sender reputation and have the best deliverability possible, take advantage of our&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/datavalidation.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/201636296\" target=\"_blank\">Email Assurance<\/a>&nbsp;subscription! Email Assurance allows you to connect your MailChimp account and have every list within that account validated. We'll monitor your lists on an ongoing basis - updating them every day to ensure that your list has updated deliverability data. This will help you avoid bounces, complainers, opt-outs, and spam-traps on an ongoing basis and utilize your email list in the best way possible!<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>(We no longer include spam traps and deceased data in determining our Email Assurance Grades - this information changes frequently and we cannot guarantee every instance to be accurate.&nbsp;This information will still be provided for each email in your Address-by-Address Analysis and can used for segmenting your list)&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">If you plan on sending a large campaign you should always have a list validated to ensure the emails on your list are clean. The more emails your have accumulated, the more likely it is that you'll have bad emails. Checking for deliverability issues proactively will avoid wasted time and late deliverability of campaigns to your customers.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">If you manage an old list, or are just unsure about how you got some of the emails on your list, stay on the safe side and have it checked for bad emails. There's no cost to get an Always Free Email Assurance Report, regardless of the number of lists you want to check and the number of emails in each list.

      "body": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Accepts All<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">A mail server that will accept mail from any host that attempts to send it mail. This happens regularly for business email addresses, and even some personal ones too. These addresses are considered to be characteristic of a spam trap as well!&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Account Flagged for Review<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">An \"Account Flagged for Review\" message from<span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"> DataValidation<\/span> means that your list has been flagged by our automated abuse detection program for containing potentially harmful data. Please contact <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Customer Support<\/span> if you've received this message.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Account Suspended (MailChimp)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">If your account has been \"Flagged for Review\", then MailChimps's review system (or human review team) noticed something about your last campaign, your account, or the lists within your account that raised a red flag for them.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Account Under Review (MailChimp)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Sometimes, MailChimp sees things that need some explaining or investigating, and the review team takes a little time to check things out. This message could have something to do with a&nbsp;campaign you sent, your account, or the lists within your account.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Address-by-Address Analysis:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">When you purchase Email Assurance or Email Validation, we'll provide you with an Address-by-Analysis of the emails within your list. This analysis contains Deliverability Codes and is what determines the overall deliverability of an email.&nbsp;We use this analysis in determining an email's Email Assurance Grade.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Blocked<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">When we say \"blocked\" we're referring to being blocked from sending email. You can be blocked from sending mail by your Email Service Provider (ESP) and if this happens, you'll need to get back in compliance with their monitoring standards. We're here to help you do that!<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Compliance<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Staying in compliance with your Email Service Provider, or with industry best practices, means that you are following general rules and guidelines, or Terms of Service. Check with your ESP to determine what your compliance standards are as far as sending email.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>Confirmed Deliverable<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">If an email has been \"confirmed deliverable\" then the address is safe to send email to. This means that deliverability has been confirmed by our system's multiple validation checks.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>CSV<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A comma-separated value (CSV) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form and is widely used by consumers and business. A .csv is one of the file formats we accept for users who want to upload email lists to our system. Once a list has been validated, you'll have the option of downloading a 'Safe to Send' List or an 'Everything' List'. Both of these lists will are available for download in a .CSV format.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Deceased Individuals<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Sometimes old email lists contain addresses belonging to people who have passed away. This email address may still be listed as active or could turn into a spam trap sometime in the future. This code indicates whether an email address belongs to a person who is deceased or not. Deceased Individuals are listed as D1 or D4 in your Address-by-Address Analysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Deliverability<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Email deliverability refers to&nbsp;the likelihood of an email reaching an inbox. The deliverability status of each address within your email list affects the overall deliverability of the list.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Deliverability Codes<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">When you upload a list or link an account, every email within the list is validated and given specific Deliverability Codes that determine the overall deliverability of that email. These codes are what determine an address's Email Assurance Grade.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Email Assurance<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Email Assurance is an ongoing monitoring service offered to clients with accounts linked directly to a MailChimp account.&nbsp;With Email Assurance, we monitor the lists within your MailChimp account, keep them up-to-date, and check for optimization and performance opportunities.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><strong>Email Assurance Grade*<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Your Email Assurance Grade is provided on your Free Email Assurance Report, and is based on the deliverability of emails within your list. Deliverability is determined by&nbsp;the Deliverability Codes provided in your Address-by-Address analysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Email Assurance Report<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">DataValidation's Free Email Assurance Report is provided for every list within your linked MailChimp account (or for every list uploaded to our system). This report provides you with an Email Assurance Grade based on the deliverability of emails in your list.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Email Service Provider (ESP)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A company offering email marketing or email services for a large number of people, allowing you to deploy campaigns to lists of subscribers. We currently partner with MailChimp to offer Email Assurance, a subscription service for Email Marketers who want to stay in compliance with ESP standards and best practices.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Email Validation<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Email Validation is a one-time cleaning service, providing you with an address-by-address analysis determining the deliverability of emails on your list. With Email Validation, you can download the \"Safe to Send\" list (containing only A+ and A results) or the \"Everything\" list (containing all emails on your list, regardless of deliverability).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Engagement History<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Now, with the new Email Assurance Grades and Deliverability Codes offered by DataValidation, you can see Engagement History for the email addresses on your list. We aggregate historical open and click information for addresses. This does not determine the likelihood of a subscriber opening or clicking your email. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Everything List<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Link a MailChimp account or upload a list and have the ability to download a 'Safe to Send' list or an 'Everything' list. The 'Everything' list contains all of your original email data and an Address-by-Address Analysis, with Deliverability Codes for each email in your list. Download this list for segmenting, or for your records, but do not deploy to the 'Everything' list.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Hard Bounce<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A hard bounce indicates a permanent reason an email cannot be delivered and can happen in the following cases:&nbsp;Recipient email address does not exist, an&nbsp;email server has completely blocked delivery, or the domain name at which you are attempting to send to does not exist.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>Historical Complainers (W)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Complainers are people who have a history of reporting email as spam. A historical complainer code will indicate whether a given email address on your list has a history of complaining about email or not.&nbsp;Historical Complainers&nbsp;are listed as a W1-W4 in your Address-by-Address Analysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Historical Hard Bounces (H)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Historical Hard Bounce information is provided for each email address within your list specifying if an address has a history of bouncing. This information is gathered in terms of the specific address, and not how many times email has bounced from you. Historical Hard Bounces are listed as a H1-H4 in your Address-by-Address Analysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Historical Opt-Out (O)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Historical Opt-Outs determine the number of people on your email list that have a history of opting-out, or unsubscribing, from email lists. A subscribers opt-out&nbsp;history is based on their overall email history and can help in determining the likelihood of opting-out from your emails as well.&nbsp;Historical Opt-Outs are listed as a O1-O4 and Historical Clicks are listed as K1-K4 in your Address-by-Address Analysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Historical Engagement (R or K)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">This is a measure of the historical level of engagement (opens and clicks) based on the amount of deliverable mail sent to an address. This is a historical reference, and <span class=\"s1\">does not determine<\/span> how likely one is to&nbsp;open or click within your email.&nbsp;Historical Opens&nbsp;are listed as a R1-R4 and Historical Clicks are listed as K1-K4 in your Address-by-Address Analysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>Indeterminate<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">When deliverability is listed as \"indeterminate\", it means that we have attempted checking an address with a mail server, but we are unable to connect. It cannot be determined whether the address is deliverable or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>IP Reputation<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Your IP Reputation is a holistic view of your IP, taking into account factors including spam complaints, reports, email deliveries, and sender actions. Activity such as bounces, spam complaints, and low open\/click rates can negatively effect your sender reputation.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Merge Fields<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Merge fields are the fields within your MailChimp account that hold additional subscriber information such as phone number, address, ect. When you link an account to DataValidation, we'll return all of the emails in your list with updated merge fields containing Deliverability Codes for each address. These codes determine the overall Deliverability Grade of the email.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>MX Lookup<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">An MX Lookup is a test we perform on that lists MX records for a domain in priority order. The MX lookup is done directly against the domain's authoritative name server, so changes to MX Records should show up instantly.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>Omnivore<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Omnivore is MailChimp's abuse-prevention initiative, gathering information from billions of emails to predict bad behavior. Omnivore gathers the necessary information it needs on email senders to keep them in compliance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Opt-In<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">Subscribers \"opt-in\" by filling out some sort of signup form for your email list. This is how you get a person's permission to email them. Best practices states that you should always use a \"double opt-in\" - having someone fill out your form first and then confirming subscription to your list.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Opt-Out \/ Unsubscribe<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">When a subscriber \"opts-out\" from an email list they are unsubscribing, and therefor revoking permission to email them.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Permission<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Having permission means having a person's consent to send them email. By opting-in to your email list, a subscriber has given you permission to send to them. According to email best practices, permission usually expires within months and needs to be re-confirmed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Re-Confirm Campaign<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A re-confirm campaign is sent to subscribers on your list whose permission has been expired. This campaign reminds clients of your past correspondance, while asking them to confirm their email opt-in.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Re-Engagement Campaign<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A re-engagement campaign is designed for subscribers that have been \"inactive\" for a period of time. This campaign is centered around providing offers and promotions to re-engage subscribers on your email list. Usually, email marketers send a re-engagement campaign before a subscriber's permission is expired.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Safe to Send List<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">When an email has been listed as \"Safe to Send\" by DataValidation, you can rest assured that this email is deliverable. After having a list validated, you'll have the option of downloading a \"Safe to Send\" or \"Everything\" list. Emails on your \"Safe to Send\" list have an Email Assurance Grade of A+ or A - Meaning they are deliverable, and in some cases have a History of Activity. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Segmentation<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">List segmentation allows you to send to a target audience within your list, without having to send a newsletter to your entire list of subscribers. With Email Validation and Email Assurance, we recommend sending only to the \"Safe to Send\" category. Segment your list by emails with an Email Assurance Grade A+ and A to ensure deliverability.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>SMTP<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">An SMTP server is a computer that receives outgoing mail messages and routes them to their intended recipients. Messages often must pass through several servers to reach their destinations, and SMTP facilitates this. An SMTP Check verifies that the server has a reverse DNS (PTR) record. It will also measure the response times for the mail server.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Soft Bounce<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Soft bounces typically indicate a temporary delivery issue for an email address. These bounces can occur because of reasons such as a subscriber's mailbox is full, a recipient email server is down or offline, or an email message is too large. MailChimp will attempt sending to soft bounces three times before they will be categorized as hard bounces.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Spam Trap<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">A spam trap is an email address that's not actively used, but is actively monitored. Spam traps can be set up to intentionally catch spammers, OR an email address that has been inactive for a long period of time may be used as a spam trap as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Stale List<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A stale list is one that has not been mailed to regularly. Usually with a stale list, the sender has failed to mail on a recurring basis OR the subscribers on the email list have become inactive and permission has expired.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Subscriber<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A subscriber is a person who has opted-in, or subscribed, to your email list. Your list(s) Email Assurance Grade is determined by the Deliverability Codes within your lists' address-by-address analysis. These Deliverability Codes provide valuable information on the subscribers within your list.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Login to&nbsp;<\/span><a style=\"color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http:\/\/datavalidation.com\/login\" target=\"_blank\">My Account<\/a><span style=\"color: #222222;\">&nbsp;| Go&nbsp;to&nbsp;<\/span><a style=\"color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http:\/\/datavalidation.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">DataValidation.com<\/a>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">&nbsp;<\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>",
