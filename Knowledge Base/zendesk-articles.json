Email Assurance is the ultimate list maintenance subscription, allowing you to monitor and remediate any Contacts automatically.</p><p>With Constant Contact, any additional data or information for Contacts (besides name, address, ect) must be stored a custom field. The only way to deploy campaigns to groups of Contacts, based on this custom data, is to create Tags.</p><p>Email Assurance runs once every day, pulling in any new Contact data you have manually added to your lists,and has been added due signup forms. Existing data within your account is also re-ran on a weekly basis. <strong>What this means is that if you've created Tags for 'Safe to Send', 'Accepts All', and 'Indeterminate' Contacts, you'll need to make sure these are refreshed each time you deploy a campaign!</strong></p><p><a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202565799-How-do-I-create-custom-Tags-in-Constant-Contact-" target="_blank">How do I create custom Tags in Constant Contact?</a></p><p><strong>How to update Tags before sending a campaign:</strong></p><p>To update Tags before sending, you'll follow almost the same procedure as creatingthem. First, you'll need to do an 'Advanced Search' for 'Safe to Send' Contacts only. These are the only contacts we recommend sending mail to.</p><p><img src="http://cdn.datavalidation.com/CC_Contacts_AdvanceSearch.png"></p><p>'Safe to Send' Contacts are all those with A+ and A grades. Remember tosearch all Contacts (and not just those within a specific list). Also, all Email Assurance Grades are listed in the format: <strong>+dv_grade_A+</strong></p><p><img src="http://cdn.datavalidation.com/CC_Contacts_AdvanceSearch_2.png"></p><p>Once you hit 'Search' you'll be taken back to the main Contacts screen. Here, click the the top left check-box to select all Contacts listed as having Email Assurance Grades of A+ and A. Click on the 'Manage Tags' button that appears when you select all, and ensure that 'Safe to Send' has a check mark by it!</p><p><img src="http://cdn.datavalidation.com/CC_UpdateTags_1.png"></p><p><strong>This is very important!</strong> Doing this assures that the 'Safe to Send' Tag has been added to all new and updated contacts with A+ and A grades. Keep in mind, the status of an email can change on a daily basis. It is not unlikely that a Contactwith a grade of D (Indeterminate) can become an A or A+.</p><p>This is what makes Email Assurance so awesome!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

This will help you to make an informed purchase decision - we believe it should always be free to know the status of your email list, at any time. Your Free Email Assurance Report will provide you with the following grades:</p><p><strong>Email Assurance Grades:</strong></p><p><strong>A+</strong>Deliverable + Engagement Activity:The emails given a grade of A+ have been determined to be deliverable. They also have engagement history concerning email clicks and opens. These addresses are always safe to send to!</p><p><strong>A</strong> Deliverable:The emails given a grade of A have been determined to be deliverable. These addresses are also safe to send to.</p><p><strong>B</strong> Accepts-all:These emails have been deemed as "Accepts-All" -Server accepts all email means that the hostname has been set to accept any mail and the email address in question may be a spam trap.This is commonly seen in business email addresses and in many cases, the server will accept all mail and then bounce it back to sender, which in turn hurts the sender's IP Reputation.We do not recommend sending to the "Accepts-All" category. All emails with a grade of B should be segmented (until later confirmed valid).</p><p><strong>D</strong>Indeterminate:In checking for an email, we were not able to do anything. The email address seems to have a mail server that is running and accepting connections, but we are unable to connect.We do not recommend sending to the "Indeterminate" category. All emails with a grade of D should be segmentedoff your list.</p><p><strong>F</strong> Undeliverable:The emails given a grade of F have been deemed as undeliverable and are therefore, invalid. These emails are unsafe to send to! These addresses should always be unsubscribed from your email database.</p><p>**After reviewing your Always Free Email Assurance Report you'll be able to make an informed purchase decision. Upon purchase, you will have access to your lists' Address-by-Address Analysis.

Each address is also provided with Deliverability Codes that determine which grade they are given.</p><p><strong>Deliverability Codes:</strong></p><p>Deliverability Codes are what make up an Email Assurance Grade, telling you which emails on your list are deliverable or not. These codes will provide information for each email based on their deliverability and email engagement status.<strong>DeliverabilityCodes</strong>are provided on a scale of 1-4, with 1 being least deliverable and 4 being most deliverable.</p><p><strong>Hard Bounces (H)</strong></p><p>Historical Hard Bounce information will be provided for each email address within your list.

Now, customers can get an overall Email Assurance Grade for their entire list. This grade is determined by the Deliverability Codes on your list.</li><li>Get more granular results from their validated lists. You're now provided with 'Accepts-All' and 'Indeterminate' results, instead of a 'Maybe' category.</li><li>Use new incorporated data from our reporting. We've added some additional Deliverability Codes, determining the overall status of an address, such as Historical Opens and Historical Clicks. </li></ul><p><strong>New Email Assurance Grades and Deliverability Codes:</strong></p><p><strong>Email Assurance Grades</strong></p><p><strong>A+</strong>Deliverable + Engagement Activity:The emails given a grade of A+ have been determined to be deliverable. They also have engagement history concerning email clicks and opens. These addresses are always safe to send to!</p><p><strong>A</strong> Deliverable:The emails given a grade of A have been determined to be deliverable. These addresses are also safe to send to.</p><p><strong>B</strong> Accepts-All:These emails have been deemed as "Accepts-All" -Server accepts all email means that the hostname has been set to accept any mail and the email address in question may be a spam trap.This is commonly seen in business email addresses and in many cases, the server will accept all mail and then bounce it back to sender, which in turn hurts the sender's IP Reputation.We do not recommend sending to the "Accept-All" category. All emails with a grade of B should be segmented (until later confirmed valid).</p><p><strong>D</strong>Indeterminate:In checking for an email, we were not able to do anything. The email address seems to have a mail server that is running and accepting connections, but we are unable to connect.We do not recommend sending to the "Indeterminate" category. All emails with a grade of D should be segmentedoff your list.</p><p><strong>F</strong> Undeliverable:The emails given a grade of F have been deemed as undeliverable and are therefore, invalid. These emails are unsafe to send to! These addresses should always be unsubscribed from your email database.</p><p>**After reviewing your Always Free Email Assurance Report you'll be able to make an informed purchase decision. Upon purchase, have access to your lists' Address-by-Address Analysis. This analysis contains Deliverability Codes which determine an email's Email Assurance Grade.Your Address-by-Address Analysiswill provide you with the following:</p><p><strong>Deliverability Codes</strong></p><p>**DeliverabilityCodes are provided on a scale of 1-4, with 1 being least deliverable and 4 being most deliverable.</p><p>Hard Bounces (H)</p><p>Historical Hard Bounce information will be provided for each email address within your list. This information provides you insight by showing you which emails have a hard bounce historyand how many sources we've received this information from.</p><p>Opt-Outs (O)</p><p>Historical Opt-Outs determine the number of people on your email list that have a history of opting-out, or unsubscribing, from email lists. A subscribers opt-outhistory is based on their overall email history and can help in determining the likelihood of opting-out from your emails as well.</p><p>Complainers (W)</p><p>Complainers are people who have a history of reporting email as spam. A historical complainer code will indicate whether a given email address on your list has a history of complaining about email or not.</p><p>Spam-Traps (T)</p><p>Emails on your list that were once deliverable and safe to send to also have the potential of turning into a spam trap if left inactive for long periods of time.When an email address is set up for the sole purpose of detecting and catching spammers, it's usually not connected to a "real" inbox and is considered a spam trap.</p><p>**Please Note:We no longer include spam trap data in determining our Email Assurance Grades (A+, A, B, D, F) - this information changes frequently and we cannot guarantee every instance to be accurate.This information will still be provided for each email in your Address-by-Address Analysis and can used for segmenting your list</p><p>Deceased Individuals (D)</p><p>Sometimes old email lists contain addresses belonging to people who have passed away. This email address may still be listed as active or could turn into a spam trap sometime in the future. This code indicates whether an email address belongs to a person who is deceased or not.</p><p>HistoricalOpens (R)</p><p>This is a measure of the historical level of engagement based on the amount of deliverable mail sent to an address. This is a historical reference, and does not determine how likely one is toopenyour email.</p><p>Historical Clicks (K)</p><p>This is a measure of the historical level of engagement based on the amount of deliverable mail sent to an address.

To avoid the stress of late delivery, or no delivery at all, we recommmend that you stay proactive in making sure your email is always deliverable. <strong>But how do you know if you're in danger of blocked?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>High bounce rates</strong>: Are many of your emails being returned to you after deploying them? You'll want to keep your bounce rate as low as possible to ensure email deliverability. This means, keeping your list clean of emails that have returned to you.</li><li><strong>Damaged IP Reputation</strong>:A sender's IP Reputation is the main factor in determining whether you can send email or not. Think of your reputation as a credit score for your email program.</li><li><strong>New list data</strong>: If you've recently added new emails to your existing list, there's always a chance that some of them could be bad. Making sure emails are valid as soon as they enter your list will keep you compliance. </li><li><strong>New campaign deployment</strong>: We always recommend having a list cleaned before deploying a campaign to any new list, especially if the list is large in size. Also, if your list is older, there's a good chance the emails on it are old too.</li><li><strong>Declining list quality</strong>: If you're noticing more and more bounces, or have received new emails from various sources, it's possible that your list quality is gradually declining.</li><li><strong>Warming up an IP</strong>: Warming up an IP Address is a gradual process. If you're new to sending email, you'll want to keep the amount of email you send gradual as well.

With Email Assurance, all of the lists within your MailChimp account are validated and then monitored on an ongoing, daily basis. Email Validation is our one-time cleaning service, providing an address-by-address analysis which determines the deliverability of emails on your list. It's recommend that you have a list cleanedat least once every 3 monthswith Email Validation.</p><p><strong>What is the monthly cost of Email Assurance?</strong></p><p>The cost of Assurance for your linked MailChimp account is based on the number of emails you have in the lists within your account. Your one-time fee (for initial list validation) can be found<a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201188896-How-do-I-know-the-cost-of-validating-my-email-list-" target="_blank">here</a>. With your first validation, you're givenone-month FREE of Email Assurance- this is so you can send a few campaigns with your newly cleaned lists and get back in compliance with MailChimp's standards. Each month after that you'll be charged based on the number of emails in your lists when Email Assurance is billed at the end of the month. Calculate your monthly Email Assurance cost<a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201188916-What-is-the-cost-of-purchasing-Email-Assurance-" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><strong>When will I be billed for Email Assurance?</strong></p><p>You are charged a one-time fee initially for the initial validation of the lists within your MailChimp account (and given Assurance for one monthFREE). After that, Email Assurance starts billing exactly one-month from when you signed up and you will be billed monthly with no long-term commitments. The cost is based on the number of emails within your lists.</p><p><strong>How often is my list validated?</strong></p><p>Email Assurance is a monthly subscription that monitors your list(s) daily, scanning for new data and cleaning it every 12 hours, then cleaning your list fullyon a once a week basis.

You can do this on thepreferences page. When you cancel, you are no longer charged with the monthly subscription fee.</p><p><strong>Does my list update automatically in MailChimp?</strong></p><p>When you purchase, your list(s) are validated, butmust be initially uploaded to your MailChimp account. This is a one-time transaction. After the cleaned list(s) have been uploaded, we will access and update your MailChimp account automatically, requiring no action from you.</p><p><strong>How do I know my MailChimp account has been updated?</strong></p><p>By looking at the Email Assurance Reports provided for your individual lists, you can tell exactly how many emails are in your list.

The number of emails in your MailChimp account should beequalto the number of emails with Email Assurance Grades of A+, A, B, and D. All emails with a grade of F are unsubscribed.</p><p><strong>Does the price change if I add additional emails to my list?</strong></p><p>If you have an Email Assurance subscription, you are billed once monthly.

      "body": "<p>Our Always Free Email Assurance Reportwillprovide you with Email Assurance Grades and show you how many of your emails fall in each category. Your Free Email Assurance Report will provide you with the following grades:</p><p><strong>Email Assurance Grades:</strong></p><p><strong>A+</strong>Deliverable + Engagement Activity:The emails given a grade of A+ have been determined to be deliverable. They also have engagement history concerning email clicks and opens. These addresses are always safe to send to!</p><p><strong>A</strong> Deliverable:The emails given a grade of A have been determined to be deliverable. These addresses are also safe to send to.</p><p><strong>B</strong> Accepts-all:These emails have been deemed as "Accepts-All" -Server accepts all email means that the hostname has been set to accept any mail and the email address in question may be a spam trap.This is commonly seen in business email addresses and in many cases, the server will accept all mail and then bounce it back to sender, which in turn hurts the sender's IP Reputation.We do not recommend sending to the "Accepts-All" category. All emails with a grade of B should be segmented (until later confirmed valid).</p><p><strong>D</strong>Indeterminate:In checking for an email, we were not able to do anything. The email address seems to have a mail server that is running and accepting connections, but we are unable to connect.We do not recommend sending to the "Indeterminate" category. All emails with a grade of D should be segmentedoff your list.</p><p><strong>F</strong> Undeliverable:The emails given a grade of F have been deemed as undeliverable and are therefore, invalid. These emails are unsafe to send to! These addresses should always be unsubscribed from your email database.</p><p>With your Address-by-Address Analysis, you can dive deep into your email list to see exactly which emails have which grade, and why they were given that grade. Each address is also provided with <strong>Deliverability Codes</strong> that determine which grade they are given.</p><p><strong>How do Spam Traps affect my Email Assurance Grades?</strong></p><p>Spam Trap data is given a Deliverability Code of T1 or T4 for each email in your Address-by-Address Analysis.</p><p><strong>We no longer include Spam Trap data in determining our Email Assurance Grades (A+, A, B, D, F). This information changes frequently and we cannot guarantee every instance to be accurate.</strong></p><p>This information will still be provided for each email in your Address-by-Address Analysis and can used for segmenting your list.A code of T1 determines which emails on your list (that were once deliverable and safe to send to) also have the potential of turning into a spam trap if left inactive for long periods of time. When an email address is set up for the sole purpose of detecting and catching spammers, it's usually not connected to a "real" inbox and is considered a spam trap.</p><p>A code of T1 or T4 specifies an emails' spam-trap information:</p><ul><li><strong>T4</strong>: We HaveNoHistorical Trap Info - This email address has no history as being a spam trap. This is not a guarantee that an email isn't a spam trap, only a historical data point.</li><li><strong>T1</strong>:Historical Spam Trap Info - This email address has been listed as a spam trap.

      "body": "<p>If you are a MailChimp customer that has recently cleaned a list, you may have been asked to send a "Reconfirm Campaign" to emails containing B and D Email Assurance grades.</p><p><strong>What is a Reconfirm Campaign?</strong></p><p>A reconfirm campaign is an email in which you ask subscribers to re-optin, and reconfirm that you have permission to email them. MailChimp requires this for any subscribers that have not been mailed to in 6 months, as well as for B and D Email Assurance grades.<a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/reconfirm-your-list" target="_blank">How to Reconfirm a List</a>as a MailChimp user.</p><p><strong>I just got my list cleaned. Why do I need to reconfirm?!</strong></p><p>MailChimp is one of the more stringent email service providers when it comes to compliance, which is why they have some of the best deliverability in the email marketing industry. A high rate of complaints, opt-outs, or bounces will affect MailChimp's overall ability to get your mail in your subscribers' inboxes. While some email service providers will let you deploy email to A+, A, B, and D results, MailChimp only allows you to send mail to A+ and A results, and requires a reconfirm campaign to protect their reputation with ISPs.</p><p>Unfortunately, you cannot use MailChimp to send the reconfirm campaign (<a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/stay-compliant-with-casl/" target="_blank">unless it is for CASL compliance</a>.) MailChimp instructs you deploy this campaign through another ESP.</p><p><strong>Is there another way to proceed without sending a reconfirm campaign?</strong></p><p>MailChimp has told our support team that this is the only way to ensure MailChimp senders maintain an optimal reputation. If you have certain email addresses that you know are active, and you have mailed to them in the past 2 weeks, you can create a manual segment with these emails and slowly trickle those emails into your campaigns. You can also sign up for <a href="http://reconfirm.io" target="_blank">Reconfirm.io</a> (currently in private beta) to send your reconfirm campaign.</p><p><strong>What's the difference between a reconfirm campaign and reengagement campaign?</strong></p><p>Before deploying a reconfirm campaign, the subscribers are removed from your Master mailing list. These subscribers are only added back on your list if they re-optin. A reconfirm campaign is a basic opt-in form and is designed to renew permissions from subscribers that have not been deployed email in 6+ months, as well as B and D Email Assurance grades.</p><p>A reengagement campaign is designed for inactive subscribers on an active, clean email list. Subscribers that have not opened or clicked in the past 3-5 months are segmented and emailed. While there are many approaches to reengagement campaigns, the goal is to get the subscriber to engage with the email. This is a best practice used by email marketers to give subscribers options to re-engage prior to pruning them from a list. If a subscriber doesn't engage with a reengagement campaign, they should not be regularly mailed as it negatively affects your sender reputation.</p><p></p><p><strong>For more on reengagement campaigns:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.datavalidation.com/blog/if-you-love-your-subscribers-let-them-go-1.html" target="_blank">If You Love Your Subscribers, Let Them Go [Part 1]</a></li><li><a href="http://www.datavalidation.com/blog/if-you-love-your-subscribers-let-them-go-2.html" target="_blank">If You Love Your Subscribers, Let Them Go [Part 2]</a></li></ul><p><strong>For more on reconfirm campaigns:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/reconfirm-your-list" target="_blank">How to Reconfirm My List</a></li><li><a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/when-email-addresses-go-stale/" target="_blank">When Email Addresses Go Stale</a></li><li><a href="http://reconfirm.io" target="_blank">Reconfirm.io</a></li></ul><p></p><p>Login to<a href="http://datavalidation.com/login" target="_blank">My Account</a>| Goto<a href="http://datavalidation.com/" target="_blank">DataValidation.com</a></p>

      "body": "<p>Email is considered one of the most important forms of communication in business and marketing; for eCommerce companies, nonprofits, and large or small businesses. Sending content to your customers is vital, regardless the size of your email list. If you have invalid emails or spam traps in these lists, your sender reputation will be negatively impacted over time, and your messages may never reach those customers. </p><p>It's important to keep your lists clean so that you can continuously send content and reach the inboxes of your valued customers. Having your emails validated will get you back to sending and is the first step in ongoing list maintenance.</p><p>To uphold a good sender reputation and have the best deliverability possible, take advantage of our<a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201636296" target="_blank">Email Assurance</a>subscription! Email Assurance allows you to connect your MailChimp account and have every list within that account validated. We'll monitor your lists on an ongoing basis - updating them every day to ensure that your list has updated deliverability data. This will help you avoid bounces, complainers, opt-outs, and spam-traps on an ongoing basis and utilize your email list in the best way possible!</p><p>(We no longer include spam traps and deceased data in determining our Email Assurance Grades - this information changes frequently and we cannot guarantee every instance to be accurate.This information will still be provided for each email in your Address-by-Address Analysis and can used for segmenting your list)</p><p>If you plan on sending a large campaign you should always have a list validated to ensure the emails on your list are clean. The more emails your have accumulated, the more likely it is that you'll have bad emails. Checking for deliverability issues proactively will avoid wasted time and late deliverability of campaigns to your customers.</p><p>If you manage an old list, or are just unsure about how you got some of the emails on your list, stay on the safe side and have it checked for bad emails. There's no cost to get an Always Free Email Assurance Report, regardless of the number of lists you want to check and the number of emails in each list.

      "body": "<p>If you use a MailChimp signup form for your email list, you'll want to make sure that only certain information is visible as people signup for your email list!</p><p>By default, MailChimp makes all merge fields visible when a subscriber signs up for your mailing list. What this means, is that when people see your signup formthey'll be able to see any information you've opted to have in your merge fields (ie. a section for phone number or address) even if you do not require this information for signup.</p><p><strong>What does this mean for DataValidation customers?</strong></p><p>When you have a list validated, or you sign up for the Email Assurance subscription, your Address-by-Address analysis, containing Email Assurance Grades and Deliverability Codes, is provided to you in your MailChimp account through the merge fields in your subscriber list. If you're using a MailChimp Signup Form, you'll want to make this information hidden.</p><p>This information does not need to be shown to potential subscribers, and it appears that they need to fill out all of the fields in this form - this may inhibit subscribers from signing up for your email list.</p><p><img src="http://cdn.datavalidation.com/KB_NewCode_CreateForm.png"></p><p>By selecting General forms you can add/edit merge fields and access field settings for a specific list. If you do not edit these, MailChimp will automatically include all merge fields within your list (including ones provided by DataValidation's analysis). Below is what an unedited signup form looks like:</p><p><img src="http://cdn.datavalidation.com/KB_NewCode_Form1.png"></p><p>What you'll need to do is edit the merge fields provided within your form. Follow these steps to ensure your subscribers only see the appropriate merged fields.</p><p>1. Select field settings on the right side of the page, and then select each field you do not want to include in your form (ie. LAST_CHANGED or grade) and make it hidden. Select the field you want to hide, select "hidden" and "save field".</p><p><img src="http://cdn.datavalidation.com/KB_NewCode_SaveField.png"></p><p>2. Make sure that all fields you DO NOT want to include in your signup form are highlighted in blue (and hidden from your form).</p><p><img src="http://cdn.datavalidation.com/KB_NewCode_HideFields.png"></p><p>3. Make sure you DO NOT delete any of these merge fields - This data is from your Address-by-Address Analysis and is important to your list and the segments within it.</p><p>4. Once you have hidden these merge fields from your form, you can preview it to make sure it is exactly what you want your potential subscribers to see. In this test form, we should only be able to see the following merge fields: Email Address, First Name, and Last Name.</p><p><img src="http://cdn.datavalidation.com/KB_NewCode_SendForm.png"></p><p>By hiding all unwanted fields, people signing up for your mailing list will not see all your data, yet this information will still be available for you in the merge fields within your list!</p><p></p><p>Login to<a href="http://datavalidation.com/login" target="_blank">My Account</a>| Goto<a href="http://datavalidation.com/" target="_blank">DataValidation.com</a></p>

This happens regularly for business email addresses, and even some personal ones too. These addresses are considered to be characteristic of a spam trap as well!</p><p><strong>Account Flagged for Review</strong></p><p>An "Account Flagged for Review" message from DataValidation means that your list has been flagged by our automated abuse detection program for containing potentially harmful data. Please contact Customer Support if you've received this message.</p><p><strong>Account Suspended (MailChimp)</strong></p><p>If your account has been "Flagged for Review then MailChimps's review system (or human review team) noticed something about your last campaign, your account, or the lists within your account that raised a red flag for them.</p><p><strong>Account Under Review (MailChimp)</strong></p><p>Sometimes, MailChimp sees things that need some explaining or investigating, and the review team takes a little time to check things out. This message could have something to do with acampaign you sent, your account, or the lists within your account.</p><p><strong>Address-by-Address Analysis:</strong></p><p>When you purchase Email Assurance or Email Validation, we'll provide you with an Address-by-Analysis of the emails within your list. This analysis contains Deliverability Codes and is what determines the overall deliverability of an email.We use this analysis in determining an email's Email Assurance Grade.</p><p><strong>Blocked</strong></p><p>When we say "blocked" we're referring to being blocked from sending email. You can be blocked from sending mail by your Email Service Provider (ESP) and if this happens, you'll need to get back in compliance with their monitoring standards. We're here to help you do that!</p><p><strong>Compliance</strong></p><p>Staying in compliance with your Email Service Provider, or with industry best practices, means that you are following general rules and guidelines, or Terms of Service. Check with your ESP to determine what your compliance standards are as far as sending email.</p><p><strong>Confirmed Deliverable</strong></p><p>If an email has been "confirmed deliverable" then the address is safe to send email to. This means that deliverability has been confirmed by our system's multiple validation checks.</p><p><strong>CSV</strong></p><p>A comma-separated value (CSV) file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain-text form and is widely used by consumers and business. A .csv is one of the file formats we accept for users who want to upload email lists to our system. Once a list has been validated, you'll have the option of downloading a 'Safe to Send' List or an 'Everything' List'. Both of these lists will are available for download in a .CSV format.</p><p><strong>Deceased Individuals</strong></p><p>Sometimes old email lists contain addresses belonging to people who have passed away. This email address may still be listed as active or could turn into a spam trap sometime in the future. This code indicates whether an email address belongs to a person who is deceased or not. Deceased Individuals are listed as D1 or D4 in your Address-by-Address Analysis.</p><p><strong>Deliverability</strong></p><p>Email deliverability refers tothe likelihood of an email reaching an inbox. The deliverability status of each address within your email list affects the overall deliverability of the list.</p><p><strong>Deliverability Codes</strong></p><p>When you upload a list or link an account, every email within the list is validated and given specific Deliverability Codes that determine the overall deliverability of that email. These codes are what determine an address's Email Assurance Grade.</p><p><strong>Email Assurance</strong></p><p>Email Assurance is an ongoing monitoring service offered to clients with accounts linked directly to a MailChimp account.With Email Assurance, we monitor the lists within your MailChimp account, keep them up-to-date, and check for optimization and performance opportunities.</p><p><strong><strong>Email Assurance Grade*</strong></strong></p><p>Your Email Assurance Grade is provided on your Free Email Assurance Report, and is based on the deliverability of emails within your list. Deliverability is determined bythe Deliverability Codes provided in your Address-by-Address analysis.</p><p><strong>Email Assurance Report</strong></p><p>DataValidation's Free Email Assurance Report is provided for every list within your linked MailChimp account (or for every list uploaded to our system). This report provides you with an Email Assurance Grade based on the deliverability of emails in your list.</p><p><strong>Email Service Provider (ESP)</strong></p><p>A company offering email marketing or email services for a large number of people, allowing you to deploy campaigns to lists of subscribers. We currently partner with MailChimp to offer Email Assurance, a subscription service for Email Marketers who want to stay in compliance with ESP standards and best practices.</p><p><strong>Email Validation</strong></p><p>Email Validation is a one-time cleaning service, providing you with an address-by-address analysis determining the deliverability of emails on your list. With Email Validation, you can download the "Safe to Send" list (containing only A+ and A results) or the "Everything" list (containing all emails on your list, regardless of deliverability).</p><p><strong>Engagement History</strong></p><p>Now, with the new Email Assurance Grades and Deliverability Codes offered by DataValidation, you can see Engagement History for the email addresses on your list. We aggregate historical open and click information for addresses. This does not determine the likelihood of a subscriber opening or clicking your email. </p><p><strong>Everything List</strong></p><p>Link a MailChimp account or upload a list and have the ability to download a 'Safe to Send' list or an 'Everything' list. The 'Everything' list contains all of your original email data and an Address-by-Address Analysis, with Deliverability Codes for each email in your list. Download this list for segmenting, or for your records, but do not deploy to the 'Everything' list.</p><p><strong>Hard Bounce</strong></p><p>A hard bounce indicates a permanent reason an email cannot be delivered and can happen in the following cases:Recipient email address does not exist, anemail server has completely blocked delivery, or the domain name at which you are attempting to send to does not exist.</p><p><strong>Historical Complainers (W)</strong></p><p>Complainers are people who have a history of reporting email as spam. A historical complainer code will indicate whether a given email address on your list has a history of complaining about email or not.Historical Complainersare listed as a W1-W4 in your Address-by-Address Analysis.</p><p><strong>Historical Hard Bounces (H)</strong></p><p>Historical Hard Bounce information is provided for each email address within your list specifying if an address has a history of bouncing. This information is gathered in terms of the specific address, and not how many times email has bounced from you. Historical Hard Bounces are listed as a H1-H4 in your Address-by-Address Analysis.</p><p><strong>Historical Opt-Out (O)</strong></p><p>Historical Opt-Outs determine the number of people on your email list that have a history of opting-out, or unsubscribing, from email lists. A subscribers opt-outhistory is based on their overall email history and can help in determining the likelihood of opting-out from your emails as well.Historical Opt-Outs are listed as a O1-O4 and Historical Clicks are listed as K1-K4 in your Address-by-Address Analysis.</p><p><strong>Historical Engagement (R or K)</strong></p><p>This is a measure of the historical level of engagement (opens and clicks) based on the amount of deliverable mail sent to an address. This is a historical reference, and does not determine how likely one is toopen or click within your email.Historical Opensare listed as a R1-R4 and Historical Clicks are listed as K1-K4 in your Address-by-Address Analysis.</p><p><strong>Indeterminate</strong></p><p>When deliverability is listed as "indeterminate it means that we have attempted checking an address with a mail server, but we are unable to connect. It cannot be determined whether the address is deliverable or not.</p><p><strong>IP Reputation</strong></p><p>Your IP Reputation is a holistic view of your IP, taking into account factors including spam complaints, reports, email deliveries, and sender actions. Activity such as bounces, spam complaints, and low open/click rates can negatively effect your sender reputation.</p><p><strong>Merge Fields</strong></p><p>Merge fields are the fields within your MailChimp account that hold additional subscriber information such as phone number, address, ect. When you link an account to DataValidation, we'll return all of the emails in your list with updated merge fields containing Deliverability Codes for each address. These codes determine the overall Deliverability Grade of the email.</p><p><strong>MX Lookup</strong></p><p>An MX Lookup is a test we perform on that lists MX records for a domain in priority order. The MX lookup is done directly against the domain's authoritative name server, so changes to MX Records should show up instantly.</p><p><strong>Omnivore</strong></p><p>Omnivore is MailChimp's abuse-prevention initiative, gathering information from billions of emails to predict bad behavior. Omnivore gathers the necessary information it needs on email senders to keep them in compliance.</p><p><strong>Opt-In</strong></p><p>Subscribers "opt-in" by filling out some sort of signup form for your email list. This is how you get a person's permission to email them. Best practices states that you should always use a "double opt-in" - having someone fill out your form first and then confirming subscription to your list.</p><p><strong>Opt-Out / Unsubscribe</strong></p><p>When a subscriber "opts-out" from an email list they are unsubscribing, and therefor revoking permission to email them.</p><p><strong>Permission</strong></p><p>Having permission means having a person's consent to send them email. By opting-in to your email list, a subscriber has given you permission to send to them. According to email best practices, permission usually expires within months and needs to be re-confirmed.</p><p><strong>Re-Confirm Campaign</strong></p><p>A re-confirm campaign is sent to subscribers on your list whose permission has been expired. This campaign reminds clients of your past correspondance, while asking them to confirm their email opt-in.</p><p><strong>Re-Engagement Campaign</strong></p><p>A re-engagement campaign is designed for subscribers that have been "inactive" for a period of time. This campaign is centered around providing offers and promotions to re-engage subscribers on your email list. Usually, email marketers send a re-engagement campaign before a subscriber's permission is expired.</p><p><strong>Safe to Send List</strong></p><p>When an email has been listed as "Safe to Send" by DataValidation, you can rest assured that this email is deliverable. After having a list validated, you'll have the option of downloading a "Safe to Send" or "Everything" list. Emails on your "Safe to Send" list have an Email Assurance Grade of A+ or A - Meaning they are deliverable, and in some cases have a History of Activity. </p><p><strong>Segmentation</strong></p><p>List segmentation allows you to send to a target audience within your list, without having to send a newsletter to your entire list of subscribers. With Email Validation and Email Assurance, we recommend sending only to the "Safe to Send" category. Segment your list by emails with an Email Assurance Grade A+ and A to ensure deliverability.</p><p><strong>SMTP</strong></p><p>An SMTP server is a computer that receives outgoing mail messages and routes them to their intended recipients. Messages often must pass through several servers to reach their destinations, and SMTP facilitates this. An SMTP Check verifies that the server has a reverse DNS (PTR) record. It will also measure the response times for the mail server.</p><p><strong>Soft Bounce</strong></p><p>Soft bounces typically indicate a temporary delivery issue for an email address. These bounces can occur because of reasons such as a subscriber's mailbox is full, a recipient email server is down or offline, or an email message is too large. MailChimp will attempt sending to soft bounces three times before they will be categorized as hard bounces.</p><p><strong>Spam Trap</strong></p><p>A spam trap is an email address that's not actively used, but is actively monitored. Spam traps can be set up to intentionally catch spammers, OR an email address that has been inactive for a long period of time may be used as a spam trap as well.</p><p><strong>Stale List</strong></p><p>A stale list is one that has not been mailed to regularly. Usually with a stale list, the sender has failed to mail on a recurring basis OR the subscribers on the email list have become inactive and permission has expired.</p><p><strong>Subscriber</strong></p><p>A subscriber is a person who has opted-in, or subscribed, to your email list. Your list(s) Email Assurance Grade is determined by the Deliverability Codes within your lists' address-by-address analysis. These Deliverability Codes provide valuable information on the subscribers within your list.</p><p></p><p>Login to<a href="http://datavalidation.com/login" target="_blank">My Account</a>| Goto<a href="http://datavalidation.com/" target="_blank">DataValidation.com</a></p>
