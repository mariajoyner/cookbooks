<p>Contacts given a grade of F are determined to be undeliverable (and unsafe to send to). If a Contact is given an F grade, the Contact will be unsubscribed from any lists it currently exists on within your Constant Contact account.<\/p>\r\n<p>The contact will be unsubscribed, but will not be totally removed. You can still locate contacts with F grades under the 'View All Contacts' tab or by searching for the email address.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>If you access the individual Contact, you'll see that it has been unsubscribed from any&nbsp;previous lists.&nbsp;<\/p>",
