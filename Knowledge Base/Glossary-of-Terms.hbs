We're here to help you do that!</p><p><strong>Compliance</strong></p><p>Staying in compliance with your Email Service Provider, or with industry best practices, means that you are following general rules and guidelines, or Terms of Service.

Once a list has been validated, you'll have the option of downloading a 'Safe to Send' List or an 'Everything' List'. Both of these lists will are available for download in a .CSV format.</p><p><strong>Deceased Individuals</strong></p><p>Sometimes old email lists contain addresses belonging to people who have passed away. This email address may still be listed as active or could turn into a spam trap sometime in the future. This code indicates whether an email address belongs to a person who is deceased or not. Deceased Individuals are listed as D1 or D4 in your Address-by-Address Analysis.</p><p><strong>Deliverability</strong></p><p>Email deliverability refers tothe likelihood of an email reaching an inbox. The deliverability status of each address within your email list affects the overall deliverability of the list.</p><p><strong>Deliverability Codes</strong></p><p>When you upload a list or link an account, every email within the list is validated and given specific Deliverability Codes that determine the overall deliverability of that email.

Segment your list by emails with an Email Assurance Grade A+ and A to ensure deliverability.</p><p><strong>SMTP</strong></p><p>An SMTP server is a computer that receives outgoing mail messages and routes them to their intended recipients. Messages often must pass through several servers to reach their destinations, and SMTP facilitates this. An SMTP Check verifies that the server has a reverse DNS (PTR) record. It will also measure the response times for the mail server.</p><p><strong>Soft Bounce</strong></p><p>Soft bounces typically indicate a temporary delivery issue for an email address. These bounces can occur because of reasons such as a subscriber's mailbox is full, a recipient email server is down or offline, or an email message is too large. MailChimp will attempt sending to soft bounces three times before they will be categorized as hard bounces.</p><p><strong>Spam Trap</strong></p><p>A spam trap is an email address that's not actively used, but is actively monitored. Spam traps can be set up to intentionally catch spammers, OR an email address that has been inactive for a long period of time may be used as a spam trap as well.</p><p><strong>Stale List</strong></p><p>A stale list is one that has not been mailed to regularly. Usually with a stale list, the sender has failed to mail on a recurring basis OR the subscribers on the email list have become inactive and permission has expired.</p><p><strong>Subscriber</strong></p><p>A subscriber is a person who has opted-in, or subscribed, to your email list. Your list(s) Email Assurance Grade is determined by the Deliverability Codes within your lists' address-by-address analysis.
