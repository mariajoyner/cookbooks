<p class=\"p1\">If you linked a MailChimp account or uploaded a list and got a message saying, \"List Flagged for Review,\" this means that your list has been flagged by our automated abuse detection program. This software scans our database to detect lists that are&nbsp;<em>potentially<\/em> harmful and pause their validation process until the list can be reviewed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">We do this to protect our system against a DHA, or Directory Harvest Attack, and keep the data of all customers safe. If a list has many addresses that are similar (ie. role addresses) such as sales@apple.com or support@apple.com, then it will be flagged for review.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">If you've noticed that your list has been flagged, you will ned to contact our support team at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:support@datavalidation.com\"><span class=\"s1\">support@datavalidation.com<\/span><\/a> with this issue. Your email list will be forwarded to an engineer for further review and we'll contact you with the updated status of your list!<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Login to&nbsp;<\/span><a style=\"color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http:\/\/datavalidation.com\/login\" target=\"_blank\">My Account<\/a><span style=\"color: #222222;\">&nbsp;| Go&nbsp;to&nbsp;<\/span><a style=\"color: #1155cc; background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"http:\/\/datavalidation.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">DataValidation.com<\/a><\/p>",
