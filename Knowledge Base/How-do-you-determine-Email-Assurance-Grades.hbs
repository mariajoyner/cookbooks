<p>The Always Free Email Assurance Report will provide you with Email Assurance Grades, depicting&nbsp;the deliverability of emails within your list. The following grades are determined by the Deliverability Codes found in your Address-by-Address Analysis:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Email Assurance Grades&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>A+<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliverable + Engagement Activity<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>A<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Deliverable<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>B<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Accepts-All<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>D&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeterminate<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>F<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Undeliverable<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Email Assurance grades are determined using the Deliverability Codes found in your Address-by-Address Analysis:<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Deliverability Codes<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>Deliverability&nbsp;Codes<\/em><\/strong><em>&nbsp;are provided on a scale of 1-4, with 1 being least deliverable and 4 being most deliverable.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>Hard Bounces (H)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Historical Hard Bounce information will be provided for each email address within your list.

A historical complainer code will indicate whether a given email address on your list has a history of complaining about email or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Spam-Traps (T) and Deceased Individuals (D)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">We no longer include spam trap data and information on deceased individuals in determining our Email Assurance Grades (A+, A, B, D, F) - This information changes frequently and we cannot guarantee every instance to be accurate.&nbsp;This information will still be provided for each email in your Address-by-Address Analysis and can used for segmenting your list.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Historical&nbsp;Opens (R)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">This is a measure of the historical level of engagement based on the amount of deliverable mail sent to an address.
