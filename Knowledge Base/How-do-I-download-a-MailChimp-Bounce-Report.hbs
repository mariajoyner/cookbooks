<p>If you're a MailChimp customer, you can easily download a Bounce Report from your MailChimp Dashboard. In the case that something goes wrong with your cleaned list, a bounce report is one of the easiest ways for us to find out what's going on with your list!<\/p>\r\n<p>To download your Bounce Report, login to your MailChimp account and access the Campaigns tab on the left-hand side of your screen. Here, you can view all&nbsp;recent campaigns&nbsp;and click \"View Report\" next to the campaign in question.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Click on \"Bounced\" under the \"Activity\" tab and here you'll be able to view which emails bounced back after sending the campaign. Simply download the report and we'll happy to take a look at it for you!<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.datavalidation.com\/KB_MailChimp_BounceReport.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"570\" height=\"359\" \/><\/p>",
