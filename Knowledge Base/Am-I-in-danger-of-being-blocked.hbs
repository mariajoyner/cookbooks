<p class=\"p1\">There&rsquo;s nothing worse than being blocked from sending email right before a campaign deployment. To avoid the stress of late delivery, or no delivery at all, we recommmend that you stay proactive in making sure your email is always deliverable. <strong>But how do you know if you&rsquo;re in danger of blocked?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>High bounce rates<\/strong>: Are many of your emails being returned to you after deploying them? You&rsquo;ll want to keep your bounce rate as low as possible to ensure email deliverability. This means, keeping your list clean of emails that have returned to you.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Damaged IP Reputation<\/strong>:&nbsp;<\/span>A sender&rsquo;s IP Reputation is the main factor in determining whether you can send email or not. Think of your reputation as a credit score for your email program.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>New list data<\/strong>: If you&rsquo;ve recently added new emails to your existing list, there&rsquo;s always a chance that some of them could be bad. Making sure emails are valid as soon as they enter your list will keep you compliance. &nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>New campaign deployment<\/strong>: We always recommend having a list cleaned before deploying a campaign to any new list, especially if the list is large in size. Also, if your list is older, there&rsquo;s a good chance the emails on it are old too.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Declining list quality<\/strong>: If you&rsquo;re noticing more and more bounces, or have received new emails from various sources, it&rsquo;s possible that your list quality is gradually declining.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li><strong>Warming up an IP<\/strong>: Warming up an IP Address is a gradual process. If you&rsquo;re new to sending email, you&rsquo;ll want to keep the amount of email you send gradual as well. Volume is a very telling factor in email compliance; and making sure you deliver to clean addresses makes the warm up process much smoother.&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>When you link an ESP account, or upload a list to DataValidation, we'll process your email list(s) and provide you with a Free EmailAssurance Report.
