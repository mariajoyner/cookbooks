<p>If you got this error when uploading a file to DataValidation, you will need to re-format your file and upload again.</p><p>When you upload a list of emails that has been saved in a format [or encoding] that we do not currently support, you will get this format error. Our system currently accepts .csv and xls. formats, but sometimes these accepted formats can still contain unsupported encoding (such as UTF-16).</p><p>Sometimes, an email list in the proper format can still contain non-english alphabet characters or other characters that our system will not accept. In many cases, unicode errors will cause the formatting to be off and the file will crash during upload.</p><p>If you get this error: "Formatting Error: Please view our Knowledge Base for accepted file types" then you will need to correct your file.</p><p>To fix this problem we recommend re-saving your .csv or .xls file with a UTF-8 encoding (instead of UTF-16 encoding) and then re-uploading. The process for doing this varies depending on your spreadsheet editor (ie. Numbers, Excel, or TextEdit).</p><p>Consult the Help section for which editor you are using and attempt reloading to the DataValidation system.</p><p></p><p>Login to<a href="http://datavalidation.com/login" target="_blank">My Account</a>| Goto<a href="http://datavalidation.com/" target="_blank">DataValidation.com</a></p>
