<p class=\"p1\"><strong>How are&nbsp;these&nbsp;results determined?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<div class=\"article-body\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">We perform several checks and verifications to determine whether an email address is valid or invalid. We do a&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\">DNS verification and MX lookup<\/span>, an&nbsp;SMTP check, and use our internal database along with proprietary algorithms to determine the validity of an email address. For more info, look&nbsp;<a href=\"\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/201202926\"><span class=\"s1\">here<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div class=\"article-body\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"article-body\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">All emails in your validated list are given an&nbsp;<a href=\"\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/201572353\" target=\"_blank\">Email Assurance Grade<\/a>.

These emails are ambiguous in nature because they may have more than one meaning.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">In checking for an email, we were not able to do anything. The email address seems to have a mail server that is running and accepting connections, but we are unable to connect.&nbsp;We do not recommend sending to the \"Indeterminate\" category.
