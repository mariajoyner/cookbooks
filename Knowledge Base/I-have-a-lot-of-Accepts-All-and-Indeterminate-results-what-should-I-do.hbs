<p><strong>How are these results determined?</strong></p><div>We perform several checks and verifications to determine whether an email address is valid or invalid. We do aDNS verification and MX lookup, anSMTP check, and use our internal database along with proprietary algorithms to determine the validity of an email address. For more info, look<a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201202926">here</a>.</div><div></div><div>All emails in your validated list are given an<a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201572353" target="_blank">Email Assurance Grade</a>. 'Accepts-All' results are given a grade of<strong>B</strong>and 'Indeterminate' results are given a grade of<strong>D</strong>.</div><p><strong><strong>What are 'Accepts-All' (B) results?</strong></strong></p><p>"Accepts-All" results are given an Email Assurance Grade of B - these email addressesare commonly seen in businesses and in many cases, the server will accept all mail and then bounce it back to sender, which in turn hurts the sender's IP Reputation.</p><p><strong>What are 'Indeterminate' (D) results?</strong></p><p>Emails labeled as 'Indeterminate'cannotbe confirmed as deliverable. These emails are ambiguous in nature because they may have more than one meaning.</p><p>In checking for an email, we were not able to do anything. The email address seems to have a mail server that is running and accepting connections, but we are unable to connect.We do not recommend sending to the "Indeterminate" category. All emails with a grade of D should be segmentedoff your list.</p><p><strong>What should I do with theseresults?</strong></p><p>We do not recommend deploying email to these category right away.These emails are NOT included in the downloadable 'Safe to Send' List. But, if you linked a MailChimp account, we include these emails in your uploaded resultsbecause theymayhave more than one meaning, and therefore may be able to be verified in the future with<a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201188886-What-is-Email-Assurance-" target="_blank">Email Assurance</a>.</p><p><strong>If you uploaded a list</strong></p><p>We recommend creatinga segment within your list named "Accepts-All" and attempt sending this group a re-engagement campaign. If you can confirm that the addresses are "valid" and deliverable, trytrickling them back into your list, so it does not affect your lists' deliverability.</p><p><strong>If you linked a MailChimp account</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Segment your list.</strong>After uploading results to MailChimp, we recommend that yousegment the listby the 'Safe to Send' category (only A+ and A results), 'Accept All' category (B results), and the 'Indeterminate' category (D results). Create segments for for each of these Email Assurance Grades tokeep your emails separate and make sending to the "safe" category much easier!If you are a MailChimp user, you<strong>must</strong>segment!</li><li><strong>Only Send to the 'Safe to Send' category.</strong>After having a list cleaned with us, you should deploy campaigns ONLY to the 'Safe to Send' emails.If you are a MailChimp user, they do not recommend sending to 'Indeterminate' or 'Accepts- All' emailsand may continue to send you warnings or block you from mailing if you deploy to these categories.</li><li><strong>Keep Segments Updated with Email Assurance.</strong>By choosing to have your MailChimp account monitored on a daily basis with Email Assurance, you are keeping all of your lists clean and segments within them separate. As you add/remove/update emails in your list, and within your segments, they will stay updated with every Assurance run.<p><a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200880479-How-do-I-create-segments-in-MailChimp-" target="_blank"><p>How do I create segments in MailChimp?</a></p><p><a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201141948" target="_blank">How do I segment a CSV?</a></p></li><li><strong>Send a Re-Engagement Campaign for 'Accepts-All' emails.</strong>As mentioned above, 'Accepts-All' emails are ambiguous and can have more than one meaning. We do not recommend sending to them immediately, but you can send a re-engagement email to those with an Email Assurance Grade of B. If confirmed as valid and still engaged, you can trickle them back into your 'Safe to Send' segmentslowly.</li><li><strong>Do not send to 'Indeterminate' email addresses.</strong>Email addresses that have an Email Assurance Grade of B can be sent a re-engagement email, but not those in the 'Indeterminate' category (with a grade of D). We recommend segmenting these indeterminate emails so that they can continue being ran by the Email Assurance subscription, but we do NOT recommend sending to this segment!</li></ol><p></p><p>Login to<a href="http://datavalidation.com/login" target="_blank">My Account</a>| Goto<a href="http://datavalidation.com/" target="_blank">DataValidation.com</a></p>
