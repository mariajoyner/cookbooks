<p>DataValidation has just released the beta version of the new Email Assurance app! If you're one of our beta testers, this article is for you. Here's everything you need to get started in the new app:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Link an ESP account<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Email Assurance allows you to link a MailChimp or Constant Contact account right off the bat! Do this when signing up, or add it later. You can add multiple accounts, and even upload .csv files if you'd like.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/datavalidation.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/article_attachments\/201033405\/Screen_Shot_2014-11-21_at_2.30.06_PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"288\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Linked and Unlinked Lists<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Once you've linked all of your ESP accounts (and uploaded all of your .csv files) you can view all lists in the Linked Lists and Unlinked Lists tabs. Linked Lists include all email lists from any linked MailChimp or Constant Contact account.<\/p>\r\n<p>Unlinked Lists include any lists from a previously linked ESP account, and all .csv files you have manually uploaded. (ie. If you unlink an ESP account, you can still find your lists in this section)<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/datavalidation.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/article_attachments\/201022145\/EA_LinkedLists_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"583\" height=\"340\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Report Cards<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Each list is given an Overall List Grade. This percentage is an average for a particular list.&nbsp;The front of each card will also tell you:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Date the list was imported to Email Assurance<\/li>\r\n<li>Number of subscribers in the list<\/li>\r\n<li>ESP Account&nbsp;<\/li>\r\n<li>ESP Account login<\/li>\r\n<li>Whether a list has been purchase<\/li>\r\n<li>How many days remaining in your 30-day free trial<\/li>\r\n<li>Whether a list is Assured\/Not Assured<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>By flipping a card over you can view the list's Report Card. A list's Report Card will tell you:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The percentage of emails that have each Email Assurance grade<\/li>\r\n<li>A description of each Email Assurance Grade<\/li>\r\n<li>Date of the list's latest validation<\/li>\r\n<li>Number of subscribers when the list was linked<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Progress Reports<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>In a list's Report Card, you can click on Progress Report to see the list's progress over time. The Progress Report also tells you the Overall List Grade, number of subscribers in the list, date the list was imported to Email Assurance, and details on the linked ESP account.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/datavalidation.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/article_attachments\/200964929\/EA_ProgressReport_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"583\" height=\"419\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>By clicking on the first data point you can see what your list looked like at the time of import. The Progress Report also shows the percentage of emails that have each Email Assurance grade. Easily compare Weekly Checks and Daily Checks.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Email Assurance runs once daily to check for newly added data and re-analyzes existing data weekly. It's free to monitor your lists for as long as you like.<\/p>\r\n<p>Purchase Email Assurance or Email Assurance Plus to sync results back to your ESP account and get an address-by-address analysis for your lists.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Sync back to an ESP<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>If you have a linked MailChimp or Constant Contact account, you can purchase Email Assurance or Email Assurance Plus and have your results automatically synced back to your ESP account. If you have the Email Assurance Plus subscription, your lists will be analyzed and synced back to your account daily.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>MailChimp users, <a href=\"\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/200880479-How-do-I-create-segments-in-MailChimp-\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">create segments<\/span><\/a> and deploy only to your Safe to Send subscribers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Constant Contact users, <a href=\"\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/202565799-How-do-I-create-custom-Tags-in-Constant-Contact-\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">create tags<\/span><\/a> and deploy only to your Safe to Send contacts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Once you've purchased, you'll also have the option of downloading an address-by-address analysis in addition to your ESP sync. If you uploaded a .csv file, you will be able to download the address-by-address analysis&nbsp;as well.<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Address-by-Address Analysis<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>This&nbsp;is a downloadable .csv file that contains an address-by-address analysis for each email within a list. This analysis contains&nbsp;deliverability data that makes up the Email Assurance grade given to a particular address.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This downloadable report has Email Assurance Grades, Historical Engagement (Clicks, Opens), Historical Bounces, Historical Complaints, Historical Opt-Outs, History of Deceased, and History of Spam Traps.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Look here for more information on the <a href=\"\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/201572353-What-do-the-codes-in-my-Email-Assurance-Report-mean-\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Address-by-Address Analysis<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\r\n<p><font size=\"4\"><strong>Add to Cart or Download<\/strong><\/font><\/p>\r\n<p>In the list view of the Email Assurance app, you have the ability to add multiple lists to a cart and download multiple items at a time.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/datavalidation.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/article_attachments\/200965189\/EA_MultipleSelections_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"366\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Dashboard<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Your Dashboard is where you can view the overall status and progress of all of the lists in your DataValidation account. Whether you have 1 linked account or 3, the Dashboard will show you Status Over Time, Assurance Coverage, New Emails Added, and Emails Unsubscribed for the current aggregate of all lists in the system.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/datavalidation.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/article_attachments\/201028345\/EA_dashboard_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"583\" height=\"410\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Aggregate Score of All Lists<\/strong>: This score can be found in the top left corner of your DataValidation Dashboard. The score takes into account every Overall List Grade.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Status Over Time<\/strong>: This percentage represents the changes (trending up or down) to the aggregate score of all lists.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Assurance Coverage<\/strong>: This is a percentage of all lists covered by the Email Assurance Plus subscription. The only lists within your account that are available for the subscription are those that have been linked by MailChimp or Constant Contact.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>New Emails Added<\/strong>: This number is the total number of emails added to your lists at this particular moment. This includes manual uploads, new signups to your list or&nbsp;new addresses&nbsp;that have been recently pulled in by Email Assurance from your ESP account.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Emails Unsubscribed<\/strong>: This represents the total number of emails unsubscribed across lists. This takes into account the number of emails unsubscribed by DataValidation (due to an F grade) and the number of emails you have manually unsubscribed or that have unsubscribed themselves from your mailings.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Linked Accounts, Profile Settings, and Billing<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>In the <strong>Linked Accounts<\/strong> tab you can view every ESP account you have linked to DataValidation. Here, you can unlink an account and refresh accounts. If you unlink an account, Email Assurance WILL NOT be able to run.&nbsp;Refreshing an account pulls in any new\/existing data from your ESP account (this can only be done once a day).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In the <strong>Profile Settings<\/strong> tab you can verify and change your primary mailing address, update personal information and change your password.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In the <strong>Billing Information<\/strong> tab you can&nbsp;save a credit card for purchases, change billing information and view any purchases you have made. You can even view your receipt for every purchase you have made!<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Notifications &amp; Cart<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Whenever you sync an ESP account, or upload a new list, you'll get notifications letting you know that your list has been analyzed.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/datavalidation.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/article_attachments\/200970589\/DV_Notifications_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"576\" height=\"262\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>You can now add lists to your cart and continue viewing reports within your Dashboard, Linked Lists, and Unlinked Lists. By clicking on the Cart notifications you can see what your total for the day is, as well as what an Email Assurance Plus subscription would look like for the lists you are purchasing.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/datavalidation.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/article_attachments\/200970649\/EA_CartNotification_1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"581\" height=\"204\" \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>Email Assurance Products<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Email Assurance Free<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>When you link an account or upload a list, you automatically have Email Assurance Free.
