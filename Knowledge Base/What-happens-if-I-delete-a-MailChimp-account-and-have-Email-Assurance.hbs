<p>When you link a MailChimp account to DataValidation we create a connection with this account so that your email list data can be updated every 12 hours.<strong>DO NOT delete a list from your MailChimp account if you want it to be included in your assurance subscription.</strong>If you delete a list from your MailChimp account that was previously covered by Email Assurance then it will be no longer covered.</p><p>By deleting a list you are breaking the connection that DataValidation has with this list specifically. When Email Assurance runs every 12 hours, this list will no longer be available for update.</p><p><strong>So what should you do if you've deleted a list that's covered with Email Assurance?</strong></p><p>You will need to re-upload this list to MailChimp for it be covered by Email Assurance and be available for update. By doing this, all of the data in your re-uploaded list will be pulled in for the next assurance run just like every other list in your MailChimp account. Email Assurance runs twice a day from 11-1 and this is when your lists will updated.</p><p>Any new lists added to your account will be also be covered Email Assurance and will be pulled into our system during the twice-daily assurance runs.</p><p><a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200880539-Does-Email-Assurance-cover-new-lists-in-my-account-" target="_blank">Does Email Assurance cover new lists in my MailChimp account?</a></p><p></p><p>Login to<a href="http://datavalidation.com/login" target="_blank">My Account</a>| Goto<a href="http://datavalidation.com/" target="_blank">DataValidation.com</a></p>
