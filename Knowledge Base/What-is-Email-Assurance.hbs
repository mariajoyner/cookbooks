With Email Assurance, all of the lists within your MailChimp account are validated and then monitored on an ongoing, daily basis. Email Validation is our one-time cleaning service, providing an address-by-address analysis which determines the deliverability of emails on your list. It's recommend that you have a list cleanedat least once every 3 monthswith Email Validation.</p><p><strong>What is the monthly cost of Email Assurance?</strong></p><p>The cost of Assurance for your linked MailChimp account is based on the number of emails you have in the lists within your account. Your one-time fee (for initial list validation) can be found<a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201188896-How-do-I-know-the-cost-of-validating-my-email-list-" target="_blank">here</a>. With your first validation, you're givenone-month FREE of Email Assurance- this is so you can send a few campaigns with your newly cleaned lists and get back in compliance with MailChimp's standards. Each month after that you'll be charged based on the number of emails in your lists when Email Assurance is billed at the end of the month.
