Now, customers can get an overall Email Assurance Grade for their entire list. This grade is determined by the Deliverability Codes on your list.</li><li>Get more granular results from their validated lists. You're now provided with 'Accepts-All' and 'Indeterminate' results, instead of a 'Maybe' category.</li><li>Use new incorporated data from our reporting. We've added some additional Deliverability Codes, determining the overall status of an address, such as Historical Opens and Historical Clicks. </li></ul><p><strong>New Email Assurance Grades and Deliverability Codes:</strong></p><p><strong>Email Assurance Grades</strong></p><p><strong>A+</strong>Deliverable + Engagement Activity:The emails given a grade of A+ have been determined to be deliverable. They also have engagement history concerning email clicks and opens. These addresses are always safe to send to!</p><p><strong>A</strong> Deliverable:The emails given a grade of A have been determined to be deliverable. These addresses are also safe to send to.</p><p><strong>B</strong> Accepts-All:These emails have been deemed as "Accepts-All" -Server accepts all email means that the hostname has been set to accept any mail and the email address in question may be a spam trap.This is commonly seen in business email addresses and in many cases, the server will accept all mail and then bounce it back to sender, which in turn hurts the sender's IP Reputation.We do not recommend sending to the "Accept-All" category. All emails with a grade of B should be segmented (until later confirmed valid).</p><p><strong>D</strong>Indeterminate:In checking for an email, we were not able to do anything. The email address seems to have a mail server that is running and accepting connections, but we are unable to connect.We do not recommend sending to the "Indeterminate" category. All emails with a grade of D should be segmentedoff your list.</p><p><strong>F</strong> Undeliverable:The emails given a grade of F have been deemed as undeliverable and are therefore, invalid. These emails are unsafe to send to! These addresses should always be unsubscribed from your email database.</p><p>**After reviewing your Always Free Email Assurance Report you'll be able to make an informed purchase decision. Upon purchase, have access to your lists' Address-by-Address Analysis. This analysis contains Deliverability Codes which determine an email's Email Assurance Grade.Your Address-by-Address Analysiswill provide you with the following:</p><p><strong>Deliverability Codes</strong></p><p>**DeliverabilityCodes are provided on a scale of 1-4, with 1 being least deliverable and 4 being most deliverable.</p><p>Hard Bounces (H)</p><p>Historical Hard Bounce information will be provided for each email address within your list. This information provides you insight by showing you which emails have a hard bounce historyand how many sources we've received this information from.</p><p>Opt-Outs (O)</p><p>Historical Opt-Outs determine the number of people on your email list that have a history of opting-out, or unsubscribing, from email lists. A subscribers opt-outhistory is based on their overall email history and can help in determining the likelihood of opting-out from your emails as well.</p><p>Complainers (W)</p><p>Complainers are people who have a history of reporting email as spam. A historical complainer code will indicate whether a given email address on your list has a history of complaining about email or not.</p><p>Spam-Traps (T)</p><p>Emails on your list that were once deliverable and safe to send to also have the potential of turning into a spam trap if left inactive for long periods of time.When an email address is set up for the sole purpose of detecting and catching spammers, it's usually not connected to a "real" inbox and is considered a spam trap.</p><p>**Please Note:We no longer include spam trap data in determining our Email Assurance Grades (A+, A, B, D, F) - this information changes frequently and we cannot guarantee every instance to be accurate.This information will still be provided for each email in your Address-by-Address Analysis and can used for segmenting your list</p><p>Deceased Individuals (D)</p><p>Sometimes old email lists contain addresses belonging to people who have passed away. This email address may still be listed as active or could turn into a spam trap sometime in the future. This code indicates whether an email address belongs to a person who is deceased or not.</p><p>HistoricalOpens (R)</p><p>This is a measure of the historical level of engagement based on the amount of deliverable mail sent to an address. This is a historical reference, and does not determine how likely one is toopenyour email.</p><p>Historical Clicks (K)</p><p>This is a measure of the historical level of engagement based on the amount of deliverable mail sent to an address. This is a historical reference, and does not determine how likely one is toclickyour email.</p><p>**Compare these new codes to <a href="https://datavalidation.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202536948" target="_blank">Old Email Assurance Codes</a>!</p><p><strong>New Always Free Email Assurance Report:</strong></p><p>The new Always Free Email Assurance Report will provide you with your list's overall deliverability by displaying the number of emails that have each Email Assurance Grade.
