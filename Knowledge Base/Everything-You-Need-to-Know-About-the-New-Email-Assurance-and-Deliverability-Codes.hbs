Now, customers can get an overall Email Assurance Grade for their entire list. This grade is determined by the Deliverability Codes on your list.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Get more granular results from their validated lists. You're now provided with 'Accepts-All' and 'Indeterminate' results, instead of a 'Maybe' category.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Use new incorporated data from our reporting. We've added some additional Deliverability Codes, determining the overall status of an address, such as Historical Opens and Historical Clicks. &nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-large\"><strong>New Email Assurance Grades and Deliverability Codes:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Email Assurance Grades&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>A+<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliverable + Engagement Activity:&nbsp;The emails given a grade of A+ have been determined to be deliverable. They also have engagement history concerning email clicks and opens. These addresses are always safe to send to!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>A<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Deliverable:&nbsp;The emails given a grade of A have been determined to be deliverable. These addresses are also safe to send to.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>B<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Accepts-All:&nbsp;These emails have been deemed as \"Accepts-All\" -&nbsp;Server accepts all email means that the hostname has been set to accept any mail and the email address in question may be a spam trap.&nbsp;This is commonly seen in business email addresses and in many cases, the server will accept all mail and then bounce it back to sender, which in turn hurts the sender's IP Reputation.&nbsp;We do not recommend sending to the \"Accept-All\" category. All emails with a grade of B should be segmented (until later confirmed valid).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>D&nbsp;<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeterminate:&nbsp;In checking for an email, we were not able to do anything. The email address seems to have a mail server that is running and accepting connections, but we are unable to connect.&nbsp;We do not recommend sending to the \"Indeterminate\" category. All emails with a grade of D should be segmented&nbsp;off your list.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>F<\/strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Undeliverable:&nbsp;The emails given a grade of F have been deemed as undeliverable and are therefore, invalid. These emails are unsafe to send to! These addresses should always be unsubscribed from your email database.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">**After reviewing your Always Free Email Assurance Report you'll be able to make an informed purchase decision. Upon purchase, have access to your lists' Address-by-Address Analysis. This analysis contains Deliverability Codes which determine an email's Email Assurance Grade.&nbsp;Your Address-by-Address Analysis&nbsp;will provide you with the following:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><strong>Deliverability Codes&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>**Deliverability&nbsp;Codes<\/em><em> are provided on a scale of 1-4, with 1 being least deliverable and 4 being most deliverable.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium wysiwyg-color-black\">Hard Bounces (H)<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Historical Hard Bounce information will be provided for each email address within your list. This information provides you insight by showing you which emails have a hard bounce history&nbsp;and how many sources we've received this information from.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Opt-Outs (O)<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Historical Opt-Outs determine the number of people on your email list that have a history of opting-out, or unsubscribing, from email lists. A subscribers opt-out&nbsp;history is based on their overall email history and can help in determining the likelihood of opting-out from your emails as well.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Complainers (W)<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Complainers are people who have a history of reporting email as spam. A historical complainer code will indicate whether a given email address on your list has a history of complaining about email or not.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Spam-Traps (T)<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Emails on your list that were once deliverable and safe to send to also have the potential of turning into a spam trap if left inactive for long periods of time.When an email address is set up for the sole purpose of detecting and catching spammers, it's usually not <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">connected to a \"real\" inbox and is considered a spam trap.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">**Please Note:&nbsp;We no longer include spam trap data in determining our Email Assurance Grades (A+, A, B, D, F) - this information changes frequently and we cannot guarantee every instance to be accurate.&nbsp;This information will still be provided for each email in your Address-by-Address Analysis and can used for segmenting your list<\/span><\/em><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Deceased Individuals (D)<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Sometimes old email lists contain addresses belonging to people who have passed away. This email address may still be listed as active or could turn into a spam trap sometime in the future. This code indicates whether an email address belongs to a person who is deceased or not.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Historical&nbsp;Opens (R)<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This is a measure of the historical level of engagement based on the amount of deliverable mail sent to an address. This is a historical reference, and <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">does not determine<\/span> how likely one is to&nbsp;open&nbsp;your email.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">Historical Clicks (K)<\/span><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This is a measure of the historical level of engagement based on the amount of deliverable mail sent to an address.
